== Introduction

{description}

NOTE: For any Infinite Scale version to upgrade to, see {ocis-downloadpage-url}?sort=time&order=desc[download.owncloud.com,window=_blank] or {docker-ocis-url}[Infinite Scale image] to get the right version.

IMPORTANT: Before starting any upgrade, make a xref:maintenance/b-r/backup.adoc[backup] first.

IMPORTANT: If not explicitly mentioned, any upgrade is forward only and a backstep is neither supported nor recommended and will most likely break the instance.

IMPORTANT: When upgrading from an older release to the desired one, *ALL* upgrade steps from each release must be taken in order and none can be skipped.
