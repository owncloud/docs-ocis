:description: Restoring from an Infinite Scale backup can be a task bringing the instance back to production after a major incident occurs.

== Introduction

{description}

Though no restore strategies are covered, reading this document can add valuable information when creating a backup and restore strategy.

== General Considerations

Infinite Scale can run in two different setups when it comes to storing data:

* All data, meaning configuration, blobs and metadata, is stored on POSIX-compliant filesystems.
* Blobs are stored on an S3-compliant storage while configuration and metadata are stored on POSIX.

See the xref:maintenance/b-r/backup.adoc#general-considerations[backup documentation] for more details.

When it comes to restoring data, keep in mind that you always have to restore all data sets consistently:

* config data
* system data ^1^
* metadata ^2^
* blobs ^2^

(1) ... System data has, if not otherwise defined, a common root path which is the same root path as for metadata. Individual paths can be defined for particular services though. See the xref:deployment/general/general-info.adoc#base-data-directory[Base Data Directory] for more details. Also see the xref:conf-examples/search/configure-search.adoc[search configuration example]. If the search index does not get restored, it needs to be recreated.

(2) ... For POSIX-only environments, the location for blobs and metadata is the same. When using S3, the location differs. The restore process must include the metadata to be complete, for details see xref:prerequisites/prerequisites.adoc#filesystems-and-shared-storage[Filesystems and Shared Storage].

Valid for all restore procedures:

* first check the basic configuration of Infinite Scale on the backup to prepare the necessary volumes, mount points and directories if they are not present on your Infinite Scale instance,
* Infinite Scale must be in stopped state.

As a rule of thumb, consider also to restore the Infinite Scale backed-up container. This avoids difficulties after restoring the instance and possibly using an updated Infinite Scale version compared to the version used when backing up. Restoring and updating should always be different tasks.

== Pure POSIX Setup

From the backup, restore:

* config data
* blobs and metadata

to their prepared locations. When done, you can start your Infinite Scale instance as usual.

== Distributed Setup

From the backup, restore:

* the configuration and metadata to the POSIX locations
* blobs to the S3 bucket according to the rules, possibilities and methods of the S3 provider.

When done, you can start your Infinite Scale instance as usual.
