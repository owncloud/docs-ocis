= Move Stuck Uploads

In some cases of saturated disk usage, Infinite Scale metadata may become stuck. This can occur when file metadata is being moved to its final destination after file operations. This issue was primarily seen with shares, where uploaded files could not be accessed. The required filename parameter aligns with Infinite Scale's internal processes and is used to complete the formerly stuck move action.

[source,bash]
----
ocis shares move-stuck-upload-blobs [--dry-run=false] -p /base/path/storage/users
----

This command provides additional options:

* `--dry-run` (default: `true`) +
Only print found files stuck in transition.
Note: This is a safety measure. You must specify `--dry-run=false` for the command to be effective.

* `--filename` value (default: "received.json") +
File to move from `uploads/` to share manager metadata `blobs/`
