= Service Health

The service health CLI command allows checking the health status of a service. If there are no issues found, nothing health related will get printed.

[source,bash]
----
ocis <service-name> health
----

Examples::
+
--
* The `collaboration` service has been started but not configured and is therefore not in a healthy state:
+
[source,bash]
----
ocis collaboration health

The WOPI secret has not been set properly in your config for collaboration. Make sure your /root/.ocis/config config contains the proper values (e.g. by using 'ocis init --diff' and applying the patch or setting a value manually in the config/corresponding environment variable).
----

* The `antivirus` service has not been started, the health check responds accordingly.
+
[source,bash]
----
ocis antivirus health

{"level":"fatal","service":"antivirus","error":"Get \"http://127.0.0.1:9277/healthz\": dial tcp 127.0.0.1:9277: connect: connection refused","time":"2024-10-28T17:47:54+01:00","message":"Failed to request health check"}
