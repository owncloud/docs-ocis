== Introduction

{description}

[NOTE]
====
* Calling a service in the examples is made via the single binary.
* Generic call: +
`ocis <service name> arguments options`.
* This changes if some services are available as executable on their own, then it would be: +
`<service name> arguments options`. +
This could happen if services are developed which are not shipped as part of the single binary.

== Reset the Admin Password

If you need to reset the admin password from the command line, follow the xref:deployment/general/general-info.adoc#password-reset-for-the-admin-user[Password Reset for the Admin User].

== Manage Expired Uploads

Compared to unfinished uploads which are handled by the system, managing expired uploads can be a necessity as those files can pile up, blocking storage resources and need to be removed by command regularly. See the xref:{s-path}/storage-users.adoc#manage-unfinished-uploads[Manage Unfinished Uploads] section at the _Storage Users_ service for details.

== Purge Expired Space Trash-Bin Items

This command is about purging old trash-bin items of `project` spaces (spaces that have been created manually) and `personal` spaces. See the xref:{s-path}/storage-users.adoc##purge-expired-space-trash-bin-items[Purge Expired Space Trash-Bin Items] section at the _Storage Users_ service for details.

== Reindex a Space for Search

In rare circumstances, it can be necessary to initiate indexing manually for a given space or user. Though the search service handles exception cases automatically, it can happen that the search service was not able to complete indexing due to a dirty shut-down of the service or because of a bug. Re-indexing should *only* be run on explicit request and supervision by ownCloud support. See the xref:{s-path}/search.adoc#manually-trigger-re-indexing-a-space[Manually Trigger Re-Indexing a Space] section at the _Search_ service for details.

== Resume Post-Processing

If post-processing fails in one step due to an unforeseen error, current uploads will not be retried automatically. A system administrator can instead run a xref:{s-path}/postprocessing.adoc#resume-post-processing[CLI command] to retry the failed upload.

== Inspect and Manipulate Node Metadata

Infinite Scale provides a xref:maintenance/commands/node-metadata.adoc[CLI command] with which you can inspect and manipulate node metadata.

WARNING: Use this command with absolute care. It is not intended to play around and should only be used on request and under supervision of ownCloud support. 

== Inspect and Repair Node Tree Sizes

Infinite Scale provides a xref:maintenance/commands/node-tree-size.adoc[CLI command] with which you can inspect and repair node tree sizes. This command can be necessary in very rare cases where spaces or files are shown in the Web UI with a size not matching reality. For the repair option Infinite Scale must be shut down.

WARNING: Use this command with absolute care. It is not intended to play around and should only be used on request and under supervision of ownCloud support. 

== Roll Back / Roll Forward Decomposedfs Migrations

A xref:maintenance/commands/rolling-back-and-forward.adoc[CLI command] is provided to roll back or roll forward a decomposedfs migration.

WARNING: Use this command with absolute care. It is not intended to play around and should only be used on request and under supervision of ownCloud support. 

== Repair and Migrate jsoncs3 Indexes

A xref:maintenance/commands/rebuild-jsoncs3-indexes.adoc[CLI command] is provided to repair and migrate jsoncs3 indexes. In rare circumstances the data for shares from the "Shared with others" and "Shared with me" index can be corrupted though no data is lost. When using this command, you can recreate that index and migrate it to a new layout which fixes the issue.

WARNING: Use this command with absolute care. It is not intended to play around and should only be used on request and under supervision of ownCloud support.
