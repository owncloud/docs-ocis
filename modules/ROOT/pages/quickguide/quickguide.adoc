== Introduction

{description}

Using this guide will get a minimal configured environment including demo users up and running but can by nature not go into depth. Note that the binary used is based on `linux-amd-64bit`.

We recommend reading the xref:deployment/index.adoc[Deployment] section of the documentation as the next step for more information on setup and configuration possibilities.
 
== Setup

Open a shell and copy/paste the following commands:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
sudo wget -O /usr/local/bin/ocis \
  {ocis-downloadpage-url}/{download-type}/{compose_version}/ocis-{compose_version}-linux-amd64
----

[source,bash]
----
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/ocis

[source,bash]

IDM_CREATE_DEMO_USERS=true \
PROXY_HTTP_ADDR=0.0.0.0:9200 \
