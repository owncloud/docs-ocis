= Metrics for Prometheus

:description: Infinite Scale exposes metrics in the prometheus format. This document gives more details how to implement and access it.

== Introduction

{description} Also see the https://prometheus.io[Prometheus] documentation for more details.

== Metrics

The Infinite Scale proxy service exposes metrics in the prometheus format. These metrics are exposed on the `/metrics` endpoint. There are two ways to run the ocis proxy service which has an impact on the number of metrics exposed.

Single Process Mode::
In single process mode, all Infinite Scale services are running inside a single process. This is the default mode when using the `ocis server` command. It is also partially true with the docker compose examples (There, both the single process and standalone mode is used). In this mode, the proxy service exposes metrics about the proxy service itself and about the services it is proxying. This is due to the nature of the prometheus registry which is a singleton.

* Metrics exposed by the proxy service itself are prefixed with `ocis_proxy_`.
* Metrics exposed by other ocis services are prefixed with `ocis_<service-name>_`.

Standalone Mode::
// grep -rl metrics.Metrics | sort | sed 's/\/.*$//' | uniq
In this mode, a service has been started independently and outside the single process mode. Either via an own defined service startup or a startup as own container via docker. The metrics of the following services are exposed on their own metrics endpoint:

| Metric Name
| Description
| Labels

| `ocis_proxy_requests_total`
| https://prometheus.io/docs/tutorials/understanding_metric_types/#counter[Counter] metric which reports the total number of HTTP requests.
| `method`: +
HTTP method of the request.

| `ocis_proxy_errors_total`
| https://prometheus.io/docs/tutorials/understanding_metric_types/#counter[Counter] metric which reports the total number of HTTP requests which have failed. That counts all response codes >= 500 
| `method`: +
HTTP method of the request.

| `ocis_proxy_duration_seconds`
| https://prometheus.io/docs/tutorials/understanding_metric_types/#histogram[Histogram] of the time (in seconds) each request took. A histogram metric uses buckets to count the number of events that fall into each bucket.
| `method`: +
HTTP method of the request.

| `ocis_proxy_build_info\{version}`
| A metric with a constant `1` value labeled by version, exposing the version of the ocis proxy service.
| `version`: +
Build version of the proxy.

== Prometheus Configuration

The following is an example prometheus configuration for the single process mode. It assumes that:

* the proxy service is configured to bind on all interfaces `PROXY_DEBUG_ADDR=0.0.0.0:9205` and 
* the proxy is available via the `ocis` service name (typically in docker-compose environments).

The prometheus service detects the `/metrics` endpoint automatically and scrapes it every 15 seconds.

IMPORTANT: Note that Metrics are on the debug port 9205 and not on port 9200 !
