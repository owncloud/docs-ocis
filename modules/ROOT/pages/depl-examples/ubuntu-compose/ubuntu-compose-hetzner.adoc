== Introduction

{description} The goal of this guide is to get you up and running as quickly as possible with a deployment setup that includes Infinite Scale and Web Office document collaboration applications for home or small business use. It also uses valid certificates from Letsencrypt.

IMPORTANT: *There are several decisions and steps that need to be taken when setting up and configuring the server. We strongly recommend that you read the manual and not just try to copy and paste commands.*

IMPORTANT: By choosing https://www.hetzner.com[Hetzner] for our cloud deployment example, you can choose from a variety of server locations, many of which are located in the EU. Using a location within the EU has a big *positive* impact on your data in terms of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

NOTE: With the minimum configuration available on Hetzner, you can start with about â‚¬4/month for a cloud driven Infinite Scale deployment. Note that prices are subject to changes and only intended for informational purposes.

NOTE: This guide references the latest {version-type} version of Infinite Scale.

NOTE: With this setup, each deployment only contains one instance of Infinite Scale.

== Requirements

=== Hardware

This guide describes an installation of Infinite Scale on the Hetzner Cloud using Ubuntu LTS as OS and docker compose. The underlying hardware can be configured according to the offers from Hetzner and your requirements. 

At minimum and at the time of writing, type _CX22_ (2 shared Intel CPU's with 4GB RAM) with 40GB embedded space can be selected. The selection can be changed after deployment if more resources are needed.

[NOTE]
====
* Disk space +
Approximately 2.4GB of disk space is required for the default enabled services, as this setup provides not only Infinite Scale, but also office suites for online collaboration and other required software.
** Depending on Hetzner's offerings, 40GB of embedded disk space is included as part of the server. If the server is reset, the disk space and ALL of its data will be lost. Consider configuring independent volumes that can be sized to your needs, but for an additional monthly fee. Note that you can start with embedded disk space and reconfigure later. See the xref:volumes[Volumes] description for an explanation of the term volume.

* Memory
** We recommend at minimum 4-6GB of memory.
** If you plan to enable antivirus scanning, see the memory consideration section in the xref:{s-path}/antivirus.adoc[antivirus] service for additional memory requirements.
