== Introduction

{description} The aim of this guide is to be up and running as fast as possible using a deployment setup that includes *Infinite Scale and web office applications for document collaboration* for home usage or small businesses. It also uses valid certificates from Letsencrypt.

IMPORTANT: *There are several decisions and steps that need to be taken when setting up and configuring the server. We strongly recommend that you read the manual and not just try to copy and paste commands.*

NOTE: This guide references the latest {version-type} version of Infinite Scale.

NOTE: With this setup, each deployment only contains one instance of Infinite Scale.

== Requirements

=== Hardware

This guide describes an installation of Infinite Scale based on Ubuntu LTS and docker compose. The underlying hardware of the server can be anything as listed below as long it meets the OS requirements defined in the xref:software-stack[Software Stack]:

* Raspberry Pi (4 and higher)
* Bare Metal Server
* Virtual Machine
* ...

[NOTE]
====
* Disk space +
Approximately 2.4GB of disk space is required for the default enabled services, as you will receive not only Infinite Scale, but also Office packages for online collaboration and other required software to run this setup. Unless otherwise specified, this guide uses Docker-managed volumes. See the xref:volumes[Volumes] description for an explanation of the term volume.

* Memory
** We recommend at minimum 4-6GB of memory.
** If you plan to enable antivirus scanning, see the memory consideration section in the xref:{s-path}/antivirus.adoc[antivirus] service for additional memory requirements. 
====

=== Knowledge Stack

You, as administrator, must have the following minimum knowledge stack.

* Being capable to order and configure external accessible domains.

* Being capable to configure: +
Router, Firewall, NAT, DHCP, networks etc.

* Command line (bash) tools like: +
ssh, actions on files, edit files etc.

* Maintaining a server: +
Setting or changing hostnames, IP configuration, installing software packages etc.

=== Software Stack

Ubuntu *LTS 24.04* has been selected as the operating system, but it will also work with Ubuntu LTS 22.04. If you already have a server running Ubuntu LTS 24.04, you can use it as long as it meets the requirements listed below

Note that this guide expects:

* A server with the operating system installed and all required software other than Infinite Scale, such as docker and docker compose, installed and preconfigured, and all software updated to the latest version.

* You have at least shell access and can ssh to your host from another machine on your network. You may need `sudo` permissions for some steps later in the setup.
