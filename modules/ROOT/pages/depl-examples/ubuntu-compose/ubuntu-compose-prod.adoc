== Introduction

{description} The aim of this guide is to be up and running as fast as possible using a deployment setup that includes *Infinite Scale and web office applications for document collaboration* for home usage or small businesses. It also uses valid certificates from Letsencrypt.

IMPORTANT: *Some decisions and steps need to be taken in order when setting up and configuring the server. We therefore highly recommend reading the guide and not just trying to copy paste commands.*

NOTE: This guide references the latest {version-type} version of Infinite Scale.

NOTE: With this setup, each deployment only contains one instance of Infinite Scale.

== Requirements

=== Hardware

This guide describes an installation of Infinite Scale based on Ubuntu LTS and docker compose. The underlying hardware of the server can be anything as listed below as long it meets the OS requirements defined in the xref:software-stack[Software Stack]:

* Raspberry Pi (4 and higher)
* Bare Metal Server
* Virtual Machine
* ...

[NOTE]
====
* Disk space +
About 2.4GB of disk space is needed for the default enabled services as you not only get Infinite Scale but also office packages for online collaboration and other required software to run this setup. If not otherwise defined, this guide uses docker managed volumes. See the xref:volumes[Volumes] description for an explanation of the term volume.

* Memory +
We recommend at minimum 4-6GB of memory. 
====

=== Knowledge Stack

You, as administrator, must have the following minimum knowledge stack.

* Being capable to order and configure external accessible domains.

* Being capable to configure: +
Router, Firewall, NAT, DHCP, networks etc.

* Command line (bash) tools like: +
ssh, actions on files, edit files etc.

* Maintaining a server: +
Setting or changing hostnames, IP configuration, installing software packages etc.

=== Software Stack

For the OS, *Ubuntu LTS 24.04* has been selected, but it will also work with Ubuntu LTS 22.04. If you already have a server running Ubuntu LTS 24.04, you can use that one as long it meets the requirements listed below. 

Note that this guide expects:

* The prerequisite of a server with the installed OS is met and any required software other than Infinite Scale like docker and docker compose is installed and preconfigured and all the software is updated to the latest version.

* You have at minimum shell access and you can reach your host via ssh from another computer in your network. `sudo` permissions may be required in some steps later in the setup.

// Hetzner provides a firewall configuration option right from the beginning, or is available after the server has been defined.
