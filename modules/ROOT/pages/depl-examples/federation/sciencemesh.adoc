== Introduction

include::partial$/multi-location/ocm-sciencemesh.adoc[]

To setup a federation using ScienceMesh, only a view steps are necessary:

* *Setup a trust* between instances involved. +
This is only required one time between instances.
* *Setup the federation* between users using generated tokens. +
This is only required one time between users who want to federate.
* *Share resources* between users of the federation.

== One Time Setup

The following description only needs to be done once per instance involved to establish a trust relationship, and requires sysadmins with access to the Infinite Scale configuration files. If a trust relationship has not been established, you must ask your sysadmin to establish one.

NOTE: For security, privacy, and data protection reasons, federation invitations are restricted to trusted instances.

Once a trust relationship is established, the user can create a federation with another user from the trusted instance to share resources. Each federation only needs to be established once.

=== Setup a Trust Relationship

NOTE: For security reasons, only the instance *admins (sysadmins)* can establish a trust relationship.

In the example below, a trust relationship is established between the `ocis.owncloud.test` and `host.docker.internal` instances.

The following requires sysadmin privileges on both parties sharing a trust::
+
--
To prepare the Infinite Scale instances involved for federation, a trust relationship must be established. This is done by creating an `ocmproviders.json` file according to the description in in xref:{s-path}/ocm.adoc#trust-between-instances[Trust Between Instances].

Once the file is properly set up, `OpenCloudMesh` must be enabled via an environment variable. See xref:{s-path}/ocm.adoc#enable-ocm[Enable OCM] for more details.

Finally, depending on the deployment, either all trusted instances or each OCM service must be restarted for the changes to take effect.
--

=== Setup a Federation Between Users

NOTE: After trust is established between instances, *users* can now establish a federation with users from another instance, the federation partner.

Before sharing resources, a sharer must first invite a partner to join a federation. This only needs to be done once per inviter/acceptor pair. This pair is now called a federation. After the federation is set up, resources can be shared with each other.
 
The following can be done by any user of the trusted instances. If xref:deployment/general/general-info.adoc#demo-users-and-groups[demo users] are set up that should not exist in production, one federation partner must be a manually created, non-demo user.

Generate an invite token for a user on another instance::
+
--
In our example, user `vlad` from instance `ocis.owncloud.test` generates the invite token. 

* Select the *ScienceMesh* application, the app selector can be opened by clicking the square icon in the upper left corner:

* The *Invitations* screen opens:
+
image:depl-examples/federation/science_mesh/sm_invitations.png[Invitations Screen, width=250]

* In *Invite Users* click btn:[Generate new invitation], the following window will appear. Optionally, enter a description and an email address of the partner user for the federation you want to create and click btn:[Generate]. If an email address is entered, a preformed URL containing the token will be sent to the invited user for easy acceptance. Note that you cannot edit a generated token. You must either recreate it or send it manually.

* Back in *Invite users*, the generated token is displayed. The remaining time to accept the invitation before it expires is also displayed.

Accept the invitation token from the federation partner::
+
--
In our example, user `ludmilla` from the `host.docker.internal` instance is the federation partner and will accept the invite token.

When the federation partner has received an email to accept the invitation, click on the btn:[link] provided in the email to open the *Invitations* screen with the pre-populated data in the *Accept invitations* window.

* Select the *ScienceMesh* application, the selector can be opened by clicking the square icon in the upper left corner:
+
image:depl-examples/federation/science_mesh/sm_select_app.png[Select the ScienceMesh App, width=250]

* The *Invitations* screen opens:
+
image:depl-examples/federation/science_mesh/sm_invitations.png[Invitations Screen, width=250]

* In the *Accept invitations* field, if not pre-populated by the email link, enter the token and select the institution of the user who sent the invitation from the drop-down box. Token and institution must match to be accepted. When finished, click btn:[Accept invitation]:
+

* In the *Federated connections* window, the established federation is now displayed and ready to share resources between the federation partners. This information is also displayed on the inviter side of the federation:
+
*Invitor:*

*Acceptor:*

== Share Resources

NOTE: An invited user must have accepted the invitation to be selected in the sharing dialog.

Once the federation is complete, federated users can share resources.

* In the menu:Files App[Inside a Space / File or Folder > Sharing Icon], switch to `external` and start typing the user name. When found, select it:

[IMPORTANT]
====
As rule of thumb:

* You *cannot* share your personal space.
* You *cannot* share a project space.
* You *should not* share files from your personal space for security reasons.
* *Only share* files and folders inside project spaces.
* You *can* edit shared files with Web Office, but you *can't* work on the same file at the same time (collaborative editing) because of locking. +
Collaborative editing would work if both instances were using the same Web Office backend.
====

* If you have more federations, you can add more users. Use the three vertical dots to select additional options. When you are done, click btn:[Share]:
+

* In menu:Files App[Shares], you can see all the shares that are: +
`Shared with me` or `Shared with others`
