== Brief Overview

NOTE: In configuration variables and comments, you'll often come across the word oCIS or ocis, short for "ownCloud Infinite Scale", while the product is simply called Infinite Scale.

=== Architecture and Concepts

To learn more about Infinite Scale, check out the xref:architecture/architecture.adoc[Architecture and Concepts] section first. This information may help deciding which environment is optimal for your use case and which hardware fits your needs best.

=== Availability and Scalability

With knowledge about architecture and concepts, look at the different xref:availability_scaling/availability_scaling.adoc[Availability and Scalability] options to define the environment Infinite Scale should run on.

=== Prerequisites

With Infinite Scale, not much is needed to run your ownCloud server the way you want. Check out the details in the xref:prerequisites/prerequisites.adoc[Prerequisites] section. We strongly recommend to make up your mind about availability and scalability first.

=== Deployment

Infinite Scale is deployed via container. Take a look at the Deployment Examples section in the navigation for more details.

NOTE: We highly recommend reading the xref:deployment/general/general-info.adoc[General Info] document first before starting to plan or deploy Infinite Scale. This document contains important topics relevant for all deployments.

=== Configuration Examples

Configuration of Infinite Scale might be quite different to what you are used to but it's very simple. It works with environment variables and optional configuration files for you to create depending on your specific needs. The settings in configuration files can always be overruled by setting the respective environment variables manually on the command line.

== Release Life Cycle

Starting with version 6 of Infinite Scale, releases are now split into `production` and `rolling`. See the https://owncloud.dev/ocis/release_roadmap/[Developer Docs Release Life Cycle] page for more details and impacts.

You can find more details on changes made in each release published in the https://doc.owncloud.com/ocis_release_notes.html[Infinite Scale Server Release Notes].

IMPORTANT: Rolling releases are published in a cycle of 3 weeks. Due to this relative short cycle, you will find the actual development and the current published rolling release documentation *not* separated. They are both part of the `next` segment in the URL. Compared to production releases where the respective release number is used, the actual rolling release number published can be found e.g. in each service description in section "Environment Variables".

== End-User License Agreement (EULA)

ownCloud provides an EULA to clarify, among various topics, who can use this software and which conditions apply to the groups of users defined. See the actual {compose_raw_url}{compose_version}/assets/End-User-License-Agreement-for-ownCloud-Infinite-Scale.pdf[EULA] for details.
