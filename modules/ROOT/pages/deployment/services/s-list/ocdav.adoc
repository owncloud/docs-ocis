=== General View

A PROPFIND finds its way to a storage provider like in the image shown below. While this is a simplification to get an understanding of what needs to go where, there are several places where sharding (splitting and distributing) can happen.

=== Proxy-based User Routing

The Infinite Scale proxy authenticates requests and can forward requests to different backends, depending on the logged-in user or cookies. For example, multiple `ocdav` services can be configured to shard users, based on username or affiliation.

=== Gateway-based Path or Storage Provider ID-based Routing

The CS3 gateway acts as a facade to multiple storage providers that can be configured with the storage registry.

=== PROPFIND Request Against Old Webdav Endpoints

This is how the old endpoint with username and a path relative to the user's home looks like: `/dav/files/\{username}`

To route a PROPFIND request against the old webdav endpoints like `/dav/files/username`, ocdav first has to build a CS3 namespace prefix, e.g. `/users/{{.Id.OpaqueId}}` to the user's home.

=== Handling Legacy Global Namespace Webdav Endpoints

The reason Infinite Scale uses a path-based lookup instead of looking up the current user's home using the user ID and a space type filter is, because there are deployments that use a global namespace at the legacy `/webdav` endpoint. To support these use cases, the gateway allows looking up spaces using their mount path.
