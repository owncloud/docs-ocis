= Auth Basic Service Configuration
:toc: right

:service_name: auth-basic

:description: The Infinite Scale Auth Basic service provides basic authentication for those clients who cannot handle OIDC. This is a rare case, is usually not necessary and mainly used for tests or development.

== Introduction

{description}

The `auth-basic` service is responsible for validating authentication of incoming requests. To do so, it will use the configured `auth manager`, see the `Auth Managers` section. Only HTTP basic auth requests to ocis will involve the `auth-basic` service.

// based on a chat with the dev team (willy, ralf). usecase would be to access via macos/finder via webdav folders on oics, or any client that cannot handle oidc.

To enable `auth-basic`, you first must set `PROXY_ENABLE_BASIC_AUTH` to `true`.

NOTE: The basic authentication implementation does not support cookies and is therefore not intended to be used for benchmarks.

== Default Values

* Auth Basic listens on port 9146 by default.

== Auth Managers

Since the `auth-basic` service does not do any validation itself, it needs to be configured with an authentication manager. One can use the `AUTH_BASIC_AUTH_PROVIDER` environment variable to configure this.

=== LDAP Auth Manager

Setting `AUTH_BASIC_AUTH_PROVIDER` to `"ldap"` will configure the `auth-basic` service to use LDAP as auth manager. This is the recommended option for running in a production and testing environment. More details on how to configure LDAP with ocis can be found in the admin docs.

=== Other Auth Managers

The possible auth mangers which can be selected are `"ldap"` and `"owncloudsql"`. Those are tested and usable though `"ldap"` is the recommend manager. Refer to the admin docs for additional information about those.

== Scalability

Scalability, just like memory and CPU consumption, are highly dependent on the configured auth manager. When using the recommended one which is `"ldap"`, there is no persistance as requests will just be forwarded to the LDAP server. Therefore, multiple instances of the `auth-basic` service can be started without further configuration. Be aware, that other auth managers might not allow that.
