== User Impersonation

When one Infinite Scale service is trying to talk to other Infinite Scale services, it needs to authenticate itself. To do so, it will impersonate a user using the `auth-machine` service. It will then act on behalf of this user. Any action will show up as action of this specific user, which gets visible when e.g. logged in to the audit log.

== Deprecation

Note that with the upcoming xref:{s-path}/auth-service.adoc[auth-service] service, the `auth-machine` service will be used less frequently and is probably a candidate for deprecation.
