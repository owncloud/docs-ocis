= Auth Bearer Service Configuration
:toc: right
:description: The Infinite Scale Auth Bearer service authenticates OpenID Connect bearer tokens.

:service_name: auth-bearer

== Introduction

{description}

// fixme: source description is still missing, and a better description is needed

== Default Values

* Users listens on port 9148 by default.

== Built in OpenID Connect Identity Provider

A default Infinite Scale deployment will start a built-in xref:{s-path}/idp.adoc[OpenID Connect identity provider] but can be configured to use an external one as well.

== Scalability

There is no persistance or caching. The xref:{s-path}/proxy.adoc[proxy] caches verified auth bearer tokens. Requests will be forwarded to the identity provider. Therefore, multiple instances of the `auth-bearer` service can be started without further configuration. Currently, the `auth` registry used by the xref:{s-path}/gateway.adoc[gateway] service can only use a single instance of the service. To use more than one auth provider per deployment, you need to scale the gateway.
This will change over time and be documented when available.
