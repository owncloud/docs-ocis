== Subscribing

Clients can subscribe to the `/sse` endpoint to be informed by the server when an event happens. The `sse` endpoint will respect language changes of the user without needing to reconnect. Note that sse has a limitation of six open connections per browser which can be reached if one has opened various tabs of the Web UI pointing to the same Infinite Scale instance.
