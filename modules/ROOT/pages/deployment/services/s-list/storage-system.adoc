== Deprecated Metadata Backend

Starting with Infinite Scale version 3.0.0, the default backend for metadata switched to messagepack. If the setting `STORAGE_SYSTEM_OCIS_METADATA_BACKEND` has not been defined manually, the backend will be migrated to `messagepack` automatically. Though still possible to manually configure `xattrs`, this setting should not be used anymore as it will be removed in a later version.
