:service_name: storage-system

== Introduction

{description}

// fixme: source description is still missing, and a better description is needed

== Default Values

* Storage-System listens on port 9215 by default.

== Caching

The `frontend` service can use a configured store via `STORAGE_SYSTEM_CACHE_STORE`.

// you must not have one or more blank lines here as it breaks continuous numbering!
. When using `redis-sentinel`, the Redis master to use is configured via `STORAGE_SYSTEM_CACHE_STORE_NODES` in the form of `<sentinel-host>:<sentinel-port>/<redis-master>` like `10.10.0.200:26379/mymaster`.

== Deprecated Metadata Backend

Starting with Infinite Scale version 3.0.0, the default backend for metadata switched to messagepack. If the setting `STORAGE_SYSTEM_OCIS_METADATA_BACKEND` has not been defined manually, the backend will be migrated to `messagepack` automatically. Though still possible to manually configure `xattrs`, this setting should not be used anymore as it will be removed in a later version.
