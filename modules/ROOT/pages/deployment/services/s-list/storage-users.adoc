:description: The Infinite Scale Storage-Users service

:service_name: storage-users

== Introduction

{description}

// fixme: source description is still missing, and a better description is needed

== Default Values

* Storage-Users listens on port 9157 by default.

== Graceful Shutdown

With Infinite Scale, you can define a graceful shutdown period for the `storage-users` service.

IMPORTANT: The graceful shutdown period is only applicable if the `storage-users` service runs as standalone service. It does not apply if the `storage-users` service runs as single Docker environment. To build an environment where the `storage-users` service runs as a standalone service, you must start two instances, one _without_ the `storage-users` service and one _only with_ the the `storage-users` service. Note that both instances must be able to communicate on the same network. 

When hard-stopping Infinite Scale, for example with the `kill <pid>` command (SIGKILL), it is possible and likely that not all data from the decomposedfs (metadata) has been written to the storage which may result in an inconsistent decomposedfs. When gracefully shutting down Infinite Scale, using a command like SIGTERM, the process will no longer accept any write requests from _other_ services and will try to write the internal open  requests which can take an undefined duration based on many factors. To mitigate that situation, the following things have been implemented:

*   With the value of the environment variable `STORAGE_USERS_GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT`, the `storage-users` service will delay its shutdown giving it time to finalize writing necessary data. This delay can be necessary if there is a lot of data to be saved and/or if storage access/throughput is slow. In such a case you would receive an error log entry informing you that not all data could be saved in time. To prevent such occurrences, you must increase the default value.

*   If a shutdown error has been logged, the command-line maintenance tool xref:maintenance/commands/commands.adoc#inspect-and-manipulate-node-metadata[Inspect and Manipulate Node Metadata] can help to fix the issue. Please contact support for details. 

== CLI Commands

For any command listed, use `--help` to get more details and possible options and arguments.

To authenticate CLI commands use:

* `OCIS_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_SECRET=<acc-secret>` and
* `OCIS_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID=<acc-id>`.

The `storage-users` CLI tool uses the default address to establish the connection to the xref:{s-path}/gateway.adoc[gateway] service. If the connection fails, check your custom `gateway` service `GATEWAY_GRPC_ADDR` configuration and set the same address in `storage-users` `OCIS_GATEWAY_GRPC_ADDR` or `STORAGE_USERS_GATEWAY_GRPC_ADDR`.

=== Manage Unfinished or Stale Uploads

When using Infinite Scale as user storage, a directory named `storage/users/uploads` can be found in the Infinite Scale data folder. This is an intermediate directory based on {tus-url}[TUS] which is an open protocol for resumable uploads. Each upload consists of a _blob_ and a _blob.info_ file. Note that the term _blob_ is just a placeholder.

* **If an upload succeeds**, the _blob_ file will be moved to the target and the _blob.info_ file will be deleted.

* **In case of incomplete uploads**, the _blob_ and _blob.info_ files will continue to recieve data until either the upload succeeds in time or the upload expires based on the `STORAGE_USERS_UPLOAD_EXPIRATION` variable, see the table below for details.

* **In case of expired uploads**, the _blob_ and _blob.info_ files will _not_ be removed automatically. Thus a lot of data can pile up over time wasting storage space.

* **In the rare case of a failure**, after the upload succeeded but the file was not moved to its target location, which can happen when postprocessing fails, the situation is the same as with expired uploads.

{empty}

Example cases for expired uploads::
* When a user uploads a big file but the file exceeds the user-quota, the upload can't be moved to the target after it has finished. The file stays at the upload location until it is manually cleared.
* If the bandwith is limited and the file to transfer can't be transferred completely before the upload expiration time is reached, the file expires and can't be processed.
* If the upload was technically successful, but the postprocessing step failed due to an internal error, it will not get further processed. See the procedure in the xref:{s-path}/postprocessing.adoc#resume-post-processing[Resume Post-Processing] documentation for details how to solve this.
* If the upload and the session for that upload gets disconnected.

The following commands are available to manage unfinished uploads::

[source,plaintext]
----
ocis storage-users uploads
NAME:
   ocis storage-users uploads - manage unfinished uploads

USAGE:
   ocis storage-users uploads command [command options]

COMMANDS:
   sessions            Print a list of upload sessions
   delete-stale-nodes  Delete all nodes in processing state that are not referenced by any upload session
   help, h             Shows a list of commands or help for one command
----

==== Sessions Command

The `sessions` command is the entry point for listing, restarting/resuming and cleaning unfinished uploads. See the xref:remove-stale-uploads[Remove Stale Uploads] command to manage uploads that have lost connection to a session.

NOTE: There can never be a clear identification of a failed upload session due to various reasons causing them. You need to apply more critera like free space on disk, a failed service like antivirus etc. to declare an upload as failed.

[NOTE]
====
If not noted otherwise, the `restart` option can also be replaced with the `resume` option. This changes behaviour slightly.

* `restart` +
When restarting an upload, all steps for open items will be restarted, except if otherwise defined.
* `resume` +
When resuming an upload, processing will continue unfinished items from their last completed step.

NAME:
   ocis storage-users uploads sessions - Print a list of upload sessions

USAGE:
   ocis storage-users uploads sessions [command options]

OPTIONS:
   --id value    filter sessions by upload session id (default: unset)
   --processing  filter sessions by processing status (default: unset)
   --expired     filter sessions by expired status    (default: unset)
   --has-virus   filter sessions by virus scan result (default: unset)
   --json        output as json                       (default: false)
   --restart     send restart event for all listed sessions (default: false)
   --resume      send resume event for all listed sessions (default: false)
   --clean       remove uploads                       (default: false)
   --help, -h    show help
----

This will always output a list of uploads that match the criteria. See the examples below.

Some additional information on returned information::
* `Offset` is the number of bytes the server has already received. +
If `Offset` == `Size` the server has received all bytes of the upload.
* `Processing` indicates if the uploaded file is currently going through postprocessing.
* `Scan Date` and `Scan Result` indicate the scanning status. +
If `Scan Date` is set and `Scan Result` is empty the file is not virus infected.

|===

The sessions command can also clear and restart/resume uploads. The output is the same as if run without the `--clean` or `--restart/--resume` option. Note that it is recommended to run the command first without the `--clean` (`--processing`) option to double check which uploads would get cleaned (restarted/resumed).

.Cleans all expired uploads regardless of processing and virus state.
[source,bash]
----
ocis storage-users uploads sessions \
     --expired=true \
     --clean
----

.Resume all uploads that are currently processing and are not virus infected
[source,bash]
----
ocis storage-users uploads sessions \
     --processing=true \
     --has-virus=false \
     --resume
----

==== Remove Stale Uploads

Unlike the xref:sessions-command[Sessions Command] set above, this command deletes (or reverts) all nodes that are in processing state and not referenced by an upload session. Although this is a very rare occurrence, a command has been added to identify and remove these stale uploads, if they exist.

This command can be used to run on a specific Space, on all Spaces, and with a dry-run option to print only stale uploads as they are found.

See the xref:maintenance/space-ids/space-ids.adoc[Listing Space IDs] to get the Space ID if you want the command to run only for a specific Space.

[source,bash]
----
ocis storage-users uploads delete-stale-nodes help
----

[source,plaintext]
----
NAME:
   ocis storage-users uploads delete-stale-nodes - Delete (or revert) all nodes in processing state that are not referenced by any upload session

USAGE:
   ocis storage-users uploads delete-stale-nodes [command options]

OPTIONS:
   --spaceid value  Space ID to check for processing nodes (omit to check all spaces)
   --dry-run        Only show what would be deleted without actually deleting (default: true)
   --verbose        Enable verbose logging (default: false)
   --help, -h       show help

=== Manage Trash-Bin Items

This command set provides commands to get an overview of trash-bin items, restore items and purge old items of `personal` spaces and `project` spaces (spaces that have been created manually). `trash-bin` commands require a `spaceID` as parameter. See xref:maintenance/space-ids/space-ids.adoc[Listing Space IDs] for details of how to get them.

[source,bash]
----
ocis storage-users trash-bin help
----

[source,plaintext]
----
COMMANDS:
   purge-expired  Purge expired trash-bin items
   list           Print a list of all trash-bin items of a space.
   restore-all    Restore all trash-bin items for a space.
   restore        Restore a trash-bin item by ID.
   help, h        Shows a list of commands or help for one command
----

==== Purge Expired

Purge all expired items from the trash-bin::
+
--
[source,bash]
----
ocis storage-users trash-bin purge-expired
----
--

The behaviour of the `purge-expired` command can be configured by using the following environment variables.

* `STORAGE_USERS_PURGE_TRASH_BIN_USER_ID` +
Used to obtain space trash-bin information and takes the system admin user as the default which is the `OCIS_ADMIN_USER_ID` but can be set individually. It should be noted, that the `OCIS_ADMIN_USER_ID` must be manually assigned in all other deployments. The command only considers spaces to which the assigned user has access and delete permission.

* `STORAGE_USERS_PURGE_TRASH_BIN_PERSONAL_DELETE_BEFORE` +
Has a default value of `720h` which equals `30 days`. This means, the command will delete all files older than `30 days`. The value is human-readable, for valid values see the duration type described in the xref:deployment/services/envvar-types-description.adoc[Environment Variable Types]. A value of `0` is equivalent to disable and prevents the deletion of `personal space` trash-bin files.

* `STORAGE_USERS_PURGE_TRASH_BIN_PROJECT_DELETE_BEFORE` +
Has a default value of `720h` which equals `30 days`. This means, the command will delete all files older than `30 days`. The value is human-readable, for valid values see the duration type described in the xref:deployment/services/envvar-types-description.adoc[Environment Variable Types]. A value of `0` is equivalent to disable and prevents the deletion of `project space` trash-bin files.

==== List and Restore Trash-Bins Items

Restoring is possible only to the original location. The personal or project `spaceID` is required for the items to be restored. To authenticate the CLI tool use:

--
`OCIS_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_SECRET=<acc-secret>` +
`OCIS_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID=<acc-id>`
--

The `storage-users` CLI tool uses the default address to establish the connection to the `gateway` service. If the connection fails, check the `GATEWAY_GRPC_ADDR` configuration from your `gateway` service and set the same address to the `storage-users` variable `STORAGE_USERS_GATEWAY_GRPC_ADDR` or globally with `OCIS_GATEWAY_GRPC_ADDR`.

{empty}

Export the gateway address if your configuration differs from the default::
+
--
[source,bash]
----
export STORAGE_USERS_GATEWAY_GRPC_ADDR=127.0.0.1:9142
----
--

Print a list of all trash-bin items of a space::
+
--
[source,bash]
----
ocis storage-users trash-bin list [command options] ['spaceID' required]
----
--

The restore option defines the behavior for an item to be restored, when the item name already exists in the target space. Supported options are: `skip`, `replace` and `keep-both`. The default value is `skip`.

When the CLI tool restores the item with the `replace` option, the existing item will be moved to a trash-bin. When the cli tool restores the item with the `keep-both` option and the designated item already exists, the name of the restored item will be changed by adding a numeric suffix in parentheses. The variable `STORAGE_USERS_CLI_MAX_ATTEMPTS_RENAME_FILE` defines a maximum number of attempts to rename an item.

Restore all trash-bin items for a space::
+
--
[source,bash]
----
ocis storage-users trash-bin restore-all [command options] ['spaceID' required]
----
--

Restore a trash-bin item by ID::
+
--
[source,bash]
----
ocis storage-users trash-bin restore [command options] ['spaceID' required] ['itemID' required]
----
--
