== Introduction

{description} 

Supported log formats are `json` or a `minimal` human-readable format. The audit service takes note of actions conducted by users and administrators.

Example minimal format::
[source,plaintext]
----
file_delete)
   user 'user_id' trashed file 'item_id'
file_trash_delete)
   user 'user_id' removed file 'item_id' from trashbin
----

Example json::
[source,json]
----
{"RemoteAddr":"","User":"user_id","URL":"","Method":"","UserAgent":"","Time":"","App":"admin_audit","Message":"user 'user_id' trashed file 'item_id'","Action":"file_delete","CLI":false,"Level":1,"Path":"path","Owner":"user_id","FileID":"item_id"}
{"RemoteAddr":"","User":"user_id","URL":"","Method":"","UserAgent":"","Time":"","App":"admin_audit","Message":"user 'user_id' removed file 'item_id' from trashbin","Action":"file_trash_delete","CLI":false,"Level":1,"Path":"path","Owner":"user_id","FileID":"item_id"}
----

The audit service is not started automatically when running as single binary started via `ocis server` or when running as docker container and must be started and stopped manually on demand.

Per default, it will be logged to standard out, but can also be configured to write into a file. Note that when a file output is used, it is not part of the standard log file but a separate one.

The audit service logs:

- File system operations +
(create/delete/move; including actions on the trash bin and versioning)
- User management operations +
(creation/deletion of users)
- Sharing operations +
(user/group sharing, sharing via link, changing permissions, calls to sharing API from clients)
