= IDM Service Configuration
:toc: right
:description: The Infinite Scale IDM service provides a minimal LDAP service for Infinite Scale. It is started as part of the runtime and serves as a central place for storing user and group information.

:service_name: idm

== Introduction

{description} The IDM Service is based on https://github.com/libregraph/idm[LibreGraph Identity Management].

[NOTE]
====
* IDM is mainly targeted at *small Infinite Scale installations* or *testing*.
* For larger setups or production environments, it is highly recommended to use a “real” LDAP server or to switch to an external Identity Management Solution instead.
====

[NOTE]
====
The IDM service is by design limited in its functionality:

* IDM only supports a subset of the LDAP operations +
namely `BIND`, `SEARCH`, `ADD`, `MODIFY` and `DELETE`.
* IDM currently does not do any LDAP schema verification like +
`structural vs. auxiliary object classes`, +
`require and option attributes`, +
`syntax checks`, …
* IDM currently does not support features like 2FA and device management.
* Check the xref:{s-path}/graph.adoc#restrict-username-patterns[Restrict Username Patterns] documentation.

Therefore the IDM service is **not** meant to replace a general purpose LDAP server.
====

== Default Values

* IDM listens on port 9325 by default.
* In the default configuration it only accepts TLS-protected connections (LDAPS).
* The BaseDN of the LDAP tree is `o=libregraph-idm`.
* IDM gives LDAP write permissions to a single user +
(DN: `uid=libregraph,ou=sysusers,o=libregraph-idm`). Any other authenticated user has read-only access.
* IDM stores its data in a `boltdb` file `idm/ocis.boltdb` inside the Infinite Scale xref:deployment/general/general-info.adoc#base-data-directory[Base Data Directory].

== Configuration Hints

=== TLS Server Certificates

By default, IDM generates a self-signed certificate and key on first startup to be able to provide TLS-protected services. The certificate is stored in `idm/ldap.crt` inside the Infinite Scale xref:deployment/general/general-info.adoc#base-data-directory[Base Data Directory]. The key is in `idm/ldap.key` in the same directory. You can use a custom server certificate by setting the `IDM_LDAPS_CERT` and `IDM_LDAPS_KEY`.

=== Default and Demo Users

On startup, IDM creates a set of default service users that are needed internally to provide access to IDM to other Infinite Scale services. These users are stored in a separate subtree.

The base DN of that subtree is: `ou=sysusers,o=libregraph-idm`.

The service users are:

* `uid=libregraph,ou=sysusers,o=libregraph-idm` +
This is the only user with write access to the LDAP tree. It is used by the Graph service to look up, create, delete and modify users and groups.

* `uid=idp,ou=sysusers,o=libregraph-idm` +
This user is used by the IDP service to perform user lookups for authentication.

* `uid=reva,ou=sysusers,o=libregraph-idm` +
This user is used by the "reva" services `user`, `group` and `auth-basic`.

IDM is also able to create xref:deployment/general/general-info.adoc#demo-users-and-groups[Demo Users]
upon startup. 

=== Access via LDAP Command Line Tools

For testing purposes it is sometimes helpful to query IDM using the ldap command line clients. To e.g. list all users, this command can be used:

[source,bash]
----
ldapsearch -x -H ldaps://127.0.0.1:9235 -x \
    -D uid=libregraph,ou=sysusers,o=libregraph-idm \
    -W -b o=libregraph-idm objectclass=inetorgperson
----

When using the default configuration with the self-signed server certificate, you might need to switch off the certificate validation using the `LDAPTL_REQCERT` env variable:

[source,bash]
----
LDAPTLS_REQCERT=never \
    ldapsearch -x -H ldaps://127.0.0.1:9235 -x \
    -D uid=libregraph,ou=sysusers,o=libregraph-idm \
    -W -b o=libregraph-idm objectclass=inetorgperson
----

Extract the `idm_password` password to enter from the `ocis.yaml` config file which is located in the Infinite Scale xref:deployment/general/general-info.adoc#configuration-directory[configuration directory].
