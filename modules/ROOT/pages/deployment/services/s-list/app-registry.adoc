= App-Registry Service Configuration
:toc: right
:description: The Infinite Scale App-Registry service is the single point where all apps register themselves and their respective supported mime types.

:service_name: app-registry

== Introduction

{description}

Administrators can set default applications on a per MIME type basis and also allow the creation of new files for certain MIME types. This per MIME type configuration also features a description, file extension option and an icon.

== Default Values

* App-Registry listens on port 9240 by default.

== MIME Type Configuration / Creation Allow List

The apps will register their supported MIME types automatically, so that users can open supported files with them.

Administrators can set default applications for each MIME type and also allow the creation of new files for certain mime types. This, per MIME type configuration, also features a description, file extension option and an icon.

=== MIME Type Configuration

Modifing the MIME type config can only be achieved via a yaml configuration. Using environment variables is not possible. For an example, see the `ocis_wopi/config/ocis/app-registry.yaml` at xref:deployment/container/orchestration/orchestration.adoc#docker-compose-examples[docker-compose example]. The following is a brief structure and a field description:

== App Drivers

App drivers represent apps if the app is not able to register itself. Currently there is only the CS3org WOPI server app driver.

=== CS3org WOPI Server App Driver

The CS3org WOPI server app driver is included in Infinite Scale by default. It needs at least one WOPI-compliant app like Collabora, OnlyOffice or the Microsoft Online Server or a CS3org WOPI bridge supported app like CodiMD or Etherpad and the https://github.com/cs3org/wopiserver[CS3org WOPI server].

=== App Provider Configuration

The configuration of the actual app provider in a xref:deployment/container/orchestration/orchestration.adoc#docker-compose-examples[docker-compose example] can be found in the full `ocis-wopi` example directory especially in the config sections `ocis-appprovider-collabora` and `ocis-appprovider-onlyoffice`.
