= NATS Service Configuration
:toc: right
:description: The NATS service is the event broker of the system. It distributes events among all other services and enables other services to communicate asynchronously.

:service_name: nats

== Introduction

{description}

Services can `Publish` events to the nats service and nats will store these events on disk and distribute these events to other services eventually.

Services can `Consume` events from the nats service by registering to a `ConsumerGroup`. Each `ConsumerGroup` is guaranteed to get each event exactly once. In most cases, each service will register its own `ConsumerGroup`. When there are multiple instances of a service, those instances will usually use that `ConsumerGroup` as a common resource.

== Default Values

* Thumbnails listens on port 9230 by default.
* The default location storing events is $OCIS_BASE_DATA_PATH/nats

== Underlying Technology

As the service name suggests, this service is based on https://nats.io/[NATS] specifically on https://docs.nats.io/nats-concepts/jetstream[NATS Jetstream] to enable persistence.

== Default Registry

By default, `nats-js-kv` is configured as the embedded default registry via the `MICRO_REGISTRY` environment variable, see the xref:deployment/services/env-vars-special-scope.adoc#extended-environment-variables[Extended Environment Variables] and xref:deployment/services/registry.adoc[Registry] documentation for more details. If you do not want using the _built-in nats_ registry, set `MICRO_REGISTRY_ADDRESS` to the address of the nats-js cluster, which is the same value as `OCIS_EVENTS_ENDPOINT`. Optionally use `MICRO_REGISTRY_AUTH_USERNAME` and `MICRO_REGISTRY_AUTH_PASSWORD` to authenticate with the external nats cluster.

NOTE: When `MICRO_REGISTRY` is configured using `kubernetes`, the Kubernetes registry will be used and not the NATS service. In this case, the `MICRO_REGISTRY_ADDRESS` environment variable needs to be set to the url of the Kubernetes registry.

== Persistence

To be able to deliver events even after a system or service restart, the built in nats will store events in a folder on the local filesystem. This folder can be specified by setting the `NATS_NATS_STORE_DIR` environment variable. If not set, the service will fall back to `$OCIS_BASE_DATA_PATH/nats`.

== TLS Encryption

Connections to the nats service (`Publisher`/`Consumer` see above) can be TLS encrypted by setting the corresponding env vars `NATS_TLS_CERT`, `NATS_TLS_KEY` to the cert and key files and `ENABLE_TLS` to true. Checking the certificate of an incoming request can be disabled with the `NATS_EVENTS_ENABLE_TLS` environment variable.

Certificate files can also be set via global variables starting with `OCIS_`, for details see the environment variable list.

Note that using TLS is highly recommended for production environments, especially when using container orchestration with Kubernetes.
