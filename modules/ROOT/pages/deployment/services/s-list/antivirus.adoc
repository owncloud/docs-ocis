== Antivirus Configuration

=== Antivirus Scanner Type

The antivirus service currently supports https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3507[ICAP] and http://www.clamav.net/index.html[clamAV] as antivirus scanners. The `ANTIVIRUS_SCANNER_TYPE` environment variable is used to select the scanner. The detailed configuration for each scanner heavily depends on the scanner type selected. See the environment variables for more details.

* For `icap`, only scanners using the `X-Infection-Found` header are currently supported.
* For `clamav`, local Unix Domain Sockets and remote network sockets can be configured either by:
** pointing to a file like `/tmp/clamd.socket` or
** with a stream socket like `tcp://host.docker.internal:3310`.

=== Maximum Scan Size

Several factors can make it necessary to limit the maximum file size the antivirus service will use for scanning. Use the `ANTIVIRUS_MAX_SCAN_SIZE` environment variable to scan only a given amount of bytes. Obviously, it is recommended to scan the whole file, but several factors like scanner type and version, bandwidth, performance issues, etc. might make a limit necessary.

=== Infected File Handling

The antivirus service allows three different ways of handling infected files. Those can be set via the `ANTIVIRUS_INFECTED_FILE_HANDLING` environment variable:

  -   *delete*: (default): Infected files will be deleted immediately, further post-processing is cancelled.
  -   *abort*:  (advanced option): Infected files will be kept, further post-processing is cancelled. Files can be manually retrieved and inspected by an admin. To identify the file for further investigation, the antivirus service logs the abort/infected state including the file ID. The file is located in the `storage/users/uploads` folder of the ocis data directory and persists until it is manually deleted by the admin via the xref:{s-path}/storage-users.adoc#manage-unfinished-uploads[Manage Unfinished Uploads] command.
  -   *continue*:  (not recommended - only for debugging): Infected files will be marked via metadata as infected but post-processing continues normally. Note: Infected Files are moved to their final destination and therefore not prevented from download which includes the risk of spreading viruses.

In all cases, a log entry is added declaring the infection, and handling method and a notification via the `userlog` service is sent.

=== Scanner Inaccessibility

In case a scanner is not accessible by the antivirus service like a network outage, service outage, or hardware outage, the antivirus service uses the `abort` case for further processing, independent of the actual setting made. In any case, an error is logged noting the inaccessibility of the scanner used.

== Operation Modes

The antivirus service can scan files during `post-processing`. `on demand` scanning is currently not available and might be added in a future release.

=== Post-processing

The antivirus service will scan files during post-processing. It listens for a post-processing step called `virusscan`. This step can be added in the environment variable `POSTPROCESSING_STEPS`. Read the documentation of the xref:{s-path}/postprocessing.adoc[postprocessing service] for more details.
