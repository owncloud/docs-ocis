= Search Service Configuration
:toc: right
:description: The Infinite Scale Search service is responsible for metadata and content extraction, stores that data as index and makes it searchable.

:tika-version: 3.2.0

:service_name: search

== Introduction

{description} The following clarifies the extraction terms _metadata_ and _content_:

* *Metadata:* all data that _describes_ the file like `Name`, `Size`, `MimeType`, `Tags` and `Mtime`.
* *Content:* all data that _relates to content_ of the file like `words`, `geo data`, `exif data` etc.

== Default Values

* Search listens on port 9220 by default.

== General Considerations

* To use the search service, an event system needs to be configured for all services like NATS, which is shipped and preconfigured.
* The search service consumes events and does not block other tasks. 
* When looking for content extraction, https://tika.apache.org[Apache Tika - a content analysis toolkit] can be used but needs to be installed separately.
** Scaling of Tika, if configured, is not part of this documentation.
* Although indexing metadata is essentially instantaneous, extracting and indexing content can take some time, depending on the setup and size of the document.
* Indexing is a non-blocking operation. It is triggered by various events.
* Consider using a dedicated hardware for this service in case more resources are needed.

NOTE: Both metadata and content extractions are stored as indexes via the search service. Keep in mind that indexing requires adequate storage capacity, and this requirement will grow over time. To prevent the index from filling up the file system and rendering Infinite Scale unusable, it should reside on its own file system.

In case the file system gets close to full and you need to relocate {service_name} data, you can change the path to where {service_name} maintains its index data.

The search service runs with the default "basic" configuration shipped out of the box. No additional configuration is necessary unless scaling or content extraction is being used.

== Space Requirements

There is no definitive answer as to how much space is needed for storing the index, nor is there a way to calculate it. The only valid answer is that it depends, and you need to monitor it. Note that monitoring is not part of this document.

Here are some notes to provide guidance:

* Although extracting and indexing metadata uses little space compared to a content index, it can be significant in environments with many files and limited file system space.
* As a rule of thumb, when extracting and indexing content, the range for the consumed index can be between 50% and 200% of the saved documents containing text. Taking a conservative approach and using a value of 150%, 3 TB of documents from which text-based data can be extracted would require up to 4.5 TB of space â€” and that's just for the content index.

IMPORTANT: If the index is left unmonitored in its default location, it can silently fill up the file system and make Infinite Scale unresponsive. Since Infinite Scale and its data share the same file system with the OS, recovery can require considerable downtime.

== Scaling

The {service_name} service can be scaled by running multiple instances. Some rules apply:

* With `SEARCH_ENGINE_BLEVE_SCALE=false`, which is the default , the {service_name} service has exclusive write access to the index. Once the first {service_name} process is started, any subsequent {service_name} processes attempting to access the index are locked out.

* With `SEARCH_ENGINE_BLEVE_SCALE=true`, a {service_name} service will no longer have exclusive write access to the index. This setting must be enabled for all instances of the {service_name} service.

== Search Engines

By default, the {service_name} service is shipped with https://github.com/blevesearch/bleve[bleve] as its primary search engine.

== Extraction Engines

The {service_name} service provides the following extraction engines and their results are used as index for searching:

* The embedded `basic` configuration provides metadata extraction which is always on. This includes all data that _describes_ the file like `Name`, `Size`, `MimeType`, `Tags` and `Mtime`.
* The `tika` configuration, which _additionally_ provides content extraction, if installed and configured. This includes all data that _relates to content_ of the file like `words`, `geo data`, `exif data` etc.

== Content Extraction

The {service_name} service can manage and retrieve many types of information. To this end, the following content extractors are included. Extraction is triggered by events, see xref:state-changes-which-trigger-indexing[State Changes which Trigger Indexing] for more details.

=== Basic Extractor

This extractor is the most simple one and just uses the resource information provided by Infinite Scale. It needs no configuration and does not do any further analysis.

=== Tika Extractor

This extractor is more advanced compared to the xref:basic-extractor[Basic extractor]. The main difference is that this extractor is able to provide file contents for the index. Though you can compile Tika manually on your system by following the https://tika.apache.org/{tika-version}/gettingstarted.html[Getting Started with Apache Tika] guide (newer Tika versions may be available) or download a precompiled https://tika.apache.org/download.html[Tika server], you can also run Tika using a https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/tika[Tika container]. See the https://github.com/apache/tika-docker#usage[Tika container usage document] for a quickstart.

As soon as Tika is installed and accessible, the search service must be configured for the use with Tika. The following settings must be set:

* `SEARCH_EXTRACTOR_TYPE=tika`
* `SEARCH_EXTRACTOR_TIKA_TIKA_URL=http://YOUR-TIKA.URL`
* `FRONTEND_FULL_TEXT_SEARCH_ENABLED=true` +
When using the Tika extractor, make sure to also set this enironment variable in the xref:{s-path}/frontend.adoc[frontend service]. This will tell the web client that full-text search has been enabled.

When the search service can reach Tika, it begins to extract content on demand. Note that files must be downloaded by Tika during the extraction process, which can lead to delays with larger documents.

When extracting content, you can specify whether [stop words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_word) like `I`, `you`, `the` are ignored or not. Normally, these stop words are removed automatically. To keep them, the environment variable `SEARCH_EXTRACTOR_TIKA_CLEAN_STOP_WORDS` must be set to `false`.

NOTE: Content extraction and handling the extracted content can be very resource intensive. Content extraction is therefore limited to files with a certain file size. The default limit is 20MB and can be configured using the `SEARCH_CONTENT_EXTRACTION_SIZE_LIMIT` variable.

When using the Tika container and docker-compose, consider the following:

* See the xref:depl-examples/ubuntu-compose/ubuntu-compose-prod.adoc[Local Production Setup] deployment example in particular the downloaded `tika.yml` file for more details.
* Containers for the linked service are reachable at a hostname identical to the alias or the service name if no alias was specified.

== Search Functionality

The {service_name} service consists of two main parts which are file `indexing` and file `searching`.

=== Indexing

Every time a resource changes its state, a corresponding event is triggered. Based on the event, the {service_name} service processes the file and adds the result to its index. There are a few more steps between accepting the file and updating the index.

=== Searching

A query via the {service_name} service will return results based on the index created.

=== State Changes which Trigger Indexing

The following state changes in the life cycle of a file can trigger the creation of an index or an update:

==== Resource Trashed

The {service_name} service checks its index to see if the file has been processed. If an index entry exists, the index will be marked as deleted. In consequence, the file won't appear in search requests anymore. The index entry stays intact and could be restored via xref:resource-restored[Resource Restored].

==== Resource Deleted

The {service_name} service checks its index to see if the file has been processed. If an index entry exists, the index will be finally deleted. In consequence, the file won't appear in search requests anymore.

==== Resource Restored

This step is the counterpart of xref:resource-trashed[Resource Trashed]. When a file is deleted, is isn't removed from the index, instead the {service_name} service just marks it as deleted. This mark is removed when the file has been restored, and it shows up in search results again.

==== Resource Moved

This comes into play whenever a file or folder is renamed or moved. The {service_name} index then updates the resource location path or starts indexing if no index has been created so far for all items affected. See xref:notes[Notes] for an example.

==== Folder Created

The creation of a folder always triggers indexing. The {service_name} service extracts all necessary information and stores it in the search index

==== File Created

This case is similar to xref:folder-created[Folder created] with the difference that a file can contain far more valuable information. This gets interesting but time-consuming when data content needs to be analyzed and indexed. Content extraction is part of the search service if configured.

==== File Version Restored

Since Infinite Scale is capable of storing multiple versions of the same file, the {service_name} service also needs to take care of those versions. When a file version is restored, the {service_name} service starts to extract all needed information, creates the index and makes the file discoverable.

==== Resource Tag Added

Whenever a resource gets a new tag, the {service_name} service takes care of it and makes that resource discoverable by the tag.

==== Resource Tag Removed

This is the counterpart of xref:resource-tag-added[Resource tag added]. It takes care that a tag gets unassigned from the referenced resource.

==== File Uploaded - Synchronous

This case only triggers indexing if `async post processing` is disabled. If so, the service starts to extract all needed file information, stores it in the index and makes it discoverable.

==== File Uploaded - Asynchronous

This is exactly the same as xref:file-uploaded-synchronous[File uploaded - synchronous] with the only difference that it is used for asynchronous uploads.

== Index Management 

=== Index Location and Scaling

* The location of the {service_name} index can be customized and should be on a fast backend.
* Consider separate hardware for the {service_name} service if response time is critical for your environment.
** Content extraction can consume considerable CPU and memory ressources and naturally competes with all other services if running on the same hardware. It has to extract every document and index it before it is available for searching.
* The {service_name} index can be manually relocated and search reconfigured to use the new path.

=== Reloacting the Index

If it becomes necessary to relocate the {service_name} index, you need to:

* Shut down the Infinite Scale instance. +
This is necessary to avoid changes that miss triggering an index update.
* Move the contents referenced via `SEARCH_ENGINE_BLEVE_DATA_PATH` to a new location.
* Define the new location in `SEARCH_ENGINE_BLEVE_DATA_PATH`.
* Restart the Infinite Scale instance.
* Update your xref:maintenance/b-r/backup.adoc[backup]/xref:maintenance/b-r/restore.adoc[restore] plan and setup accordingly.

=== Index Maintenance

It can happen that an index needs to be recreated. Currently this can only be done on a per space / all spaces basis.

==== Manually Trigger Re-Indexing Spaces

The service includes a command-line interface to trigger re-indexing spaces:

[source,bash]
----
ocis search index --space $SPACE_ID || --all-spaces
----

* IDs but not names are necessary as parameter.
** See the xref:maintenance/space-ids/space-ids.adoc[Listing Space IDs] for how to retrieve a space ID.
* The arguments `-space` and `--all-spaces` are mutual exclusive , but one must be provided.

== Notes

The indexing process tries to be self-healing in some situations.

In the following example, let's assume a file tree `foo/bar/baz` exists. If the folder `bar` gets renamed to `new-bar`, the path to `baz` is no longer `foo/bar/baz` but `foo/new-bar/baz`. The search service checks the change and either just updates the path in the index or creates a new index for all items affected if none was present.
