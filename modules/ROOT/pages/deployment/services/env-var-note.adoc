:description: Environment variables are key to configure Infinite Scale. To understand variables in a proper way, some notes are made.

== Reading Notes

Service name vs. environment variable name::
+
[TIP]
====
Environment variable names are always upper case and words are connected with an underscore. They start with the name of the service. If the service name is more than one word and the words are connected with a dash, the dash is replaced by an underscore. This info is useful when you search for environment variables based on the service name.

Example: `auth-basic` -> `AUTH_BASIC_XXX`
====

Global scale environment variables::
Environment variables starting with `OCIS_` are variables that have a global scope. This means, their setting is valid for all services, if not explicitly overwritten by a corresponding service variable.

Multiple environment variables for the same purpose::
+
[TIP]
====
In the tables describing the environment variables, you may occasionally see two environment variables in the same row configuring the same task. In such a case, the following rule applies:

* The first environment variable is used on a global scale. If set, it will be used in all services where applicable.
* The second environment variable overwrites the first one, but ONLY for the one particular service.

Taking the `webdav` service as an example, you want to set the `OCIS_URL` as a generic value, but for webdav, you want to use a different URL defined with `OCIS_PUBLIC_URL`.
====

Default values containing curly brackets::
+
[TIP]
====
In the table showing the environment variables of a service, the _Default Value_ cell can sometimes contain values with curly brackets like `{{.Id.OpaqueId}}`. These are valid defaults.
====

Note on paths for binary vs. container installations::
If a service offers path customization like the `IDM_LDAPS_CERT` (see the xref:{s-path}/idm.adoc[IDM] documentation), the path set references the environment used. This means:
+
--
* When using the binary installation, the path is based on the host filesystem.
* When using a container installation, the path references a target inside the container.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you're using a container and want or need to keep all data persistent, you need to provide host filesystem access to the container, which you can do with mounts or volumes.

== Using Environment Variables in YAML

Environment variables can be used in yaml config files. This allows them to be used in config files for Infinite Scale services, which will then be replaced by the actual value of the environment variable at runtime.

Example:

[source,yaml]
----
web:
  http:
    addr: ${SOME_HTTP_ADDR}
----

This makes it possible to use the same config file for different environments, without the need to change the config file itself. Such a setting is especially useful when using docker compose to run Infinite Scale services. It is a common pattern to create an `.env` file which contains the environment variables to be used with docker compose. Now you can use the same `.env` file to configure the Infinite Scale services via yaml.
