= Environment Variables with Special Scopes
:toc: right
:description: Some environment variables have a special, extended or global scope. Variables with special scope are related to a deployment method only.

// there is only an adoc table to include but no yaml file. this is only when using special scope envvars.
:no_yaml: true

== Introduction

{description} Variables with an extended scope do not directly configure services but functions underneath. Variables with a global scope can configure more than one service.

Examples:

* The global environment variable `OCIS_LOG_LEVEL` is available in multiple services.
* The extended environment variable `OCIS_CONFIG_DIR` can be used with `ocis init`.
* The special environment variable `OCIS_RUN_SERVICES` is only available with a binary deployment.

== Special Environment Variables

// these envvars cant be gathered automatically and must be maintained manually.
// their source is in: https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/blob/master/ocis-pkg/config/config.go
// at 'type Runtime struct'

The following environment variables are only available with the xref:deployment/binary/binary-setup.adoc[Binary Setup]:
