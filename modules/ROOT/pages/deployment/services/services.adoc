:toc: right
:description: The Infinite Scale platform consists of microservices interconnecting with each other. Each service performs a particular task and can be configured independently.

== Introduction

{description} Services started with the runtime share the runtime management while services running outside the runtime are managed on their own but connect to each other when necessary.

For more details see xref:deployment/general/general-info.adoc#managing-services[Managing Services].

There are descriptions and configuration details for each service available.

When a service gets added to Infinite Scale, a page describing the service is added but the configuration will only show up for those releases where the service is available.

Also see the supporting documents describing various topics around services.
