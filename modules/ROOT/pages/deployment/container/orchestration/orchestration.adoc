== Introduction

{description}  These are {docker-compose-url}[Docker-Compose] and {kubernetes-url}[Kubernetes]. Other container orchestration tools like {docker-swarm-url}[Docker Swarm] can be derived from these.

Container orchestration tools are necessary to meet the requirements described in the xref:availability_scaling/availability_scaling.adoc#container[Availability and Scalability] guide starting at the _Container_ section.

The pages

* {swarm-v-kub-1-url}[Docker Swarm vs Kubernetes: how to choose a container orchestration tool] and
* {swarm-v-kub-2-url}[Kubernetes Vs. Docker Swarm: A Comparison of Containerization Platforms]

give a brief overview of features and characteristics of both tools.

For Kubernetes, ownCloud provides basic {helm-charts-ocis-url}[Helm Charts] that can be used and adjusted.

IMPORTANT: ownCloud highly recommends reading the xref:deployment/general/general-info.adoc[General Info] as it contains valuable information about configuration rules, managing services and default paths - just to mention some of the useful topics.

== Docker Compose

Similar to using _docker run_ and handing over command-line parameters for a single container, you can use a `docker-compose.yml` yaml file which defines all the settings and environment variables for each container in one or more files. This is the next step when having multi-container environments.

* Consider that when planning to run Infinite Scale via Docker Compose, the degree of freedom is not the same as when using Kubernetes with Helm as you are limited to the same server and other limitations but it usually offers more than running the pure binary when it comes to ease of configuration and maintaining your environment.

* Use Docker Compose if you aim at an extended degree of freedom compared to the binary installation but don't need the full capabilities of Kubernetes and Helm.

=== Prerequisites

Check if the package `docker-compose` is installed in addition to docker:

[source,bash]
----
which docker-compose
----

If `docker-compose` is installed, you'll be informed. If not, you may get no output at all or a message that it couldn't be found. In that case you need to install `docker-compose` first. On most Linux distributions, you can simply use the package manager to do so.

Note that in many cases, this will install a 1.x version (python-based) only supported until June 2023. Version 2.x (go-based) is available from Docker. Follow the {docker-compose-install-url}[Install Docker Compose] guide to install a 2.x version. Familiarize yourself with the {docker-compose-evolution-url}[differences between versions] particularly with regard to syntax changes. Most of our examples are still based on Compose-V1. One major difference is, that compose is now a plugin of docker, even if there is still a standalone version. If the check above fails, you might also want to test:

[source,bash]
----
docker compose version
----

When done, create a project directory like `ocis-compose` in your home directory to have a common location for your Infinite Scale Compose files.

=== Docker Compose Examples

* See the xref:deployment/services/services.adoc[services section] for details about available environment variables and yaml files.

* See below for example service configurations using Docker Compose, to get a first impression of how this can be achieved. Both _ocis environment variables_ and _ocis service configuration_ yaml files are used.

+
--
{composer-url}{compose_tab_1}{composer-final-path}[Docker Compose deployment examples directory,window=_blank]

Using git version name: `{compose_tab_1}`
--
====
+
--
Note that github will not let you download a single directory easily. You can get the examples using the following methods requiring minimum space. For stable releases, check or update the version accordingly like when there is a new patch release available:

* Using a shallow git clone which minimizes the required clone space like:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/owncloud/ocis.git -b {compose_tab_1_tab_text}
----

// https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7106012/download-a-single-folder-or-directory-from-a-github-repo

* Using an external page providing you the folder to download as zip file like:
+
[source,plaintext,subs="attributes+"]
----
{download-gh-directory-url}?url={composer-url}{compose_tab_1}{composer-final-path}
----
--

== Kubernetes and Helm

The commands and examples are based on software from Kubernetes and Helm. For other software products or environments without claim to completeness like:

* OpenShift
* Rancher
* K3s
* AWS EKS
* GCP GKE
* Azure AKS

you may need to adapt the commands and possibly the provided yaml files. As an example, OpenShift requires, if not otherwise defined, the container user and password ID to be a very high number. Check your software or environment for details and requirements.

Note that this does not affect the supported Kubernetes versions. Any software or environment must match the version standards.

=== Kubernetes

{kubernetes-url}[Kubernetes] (abbreviated as K8s) is an open-source platform for governing clusters of containerized application services. Kubernetes automates the vital aspects of container lifecycle management, including scaling, replication, monitoring, and scheduling. It offers a framework for distributed systems. Infinite Scale was designed with Kubernetes in mind. Therefore ownCloud provides Helm charts for a convenient deployment of Infinite Scale on a Kubernetes cluster.

////
For more information on Kubernetes (K8s) features, check out {why-K8s-url}[Why you need Kubernetes and what it can do]. If that is too abstract, there is an {eli5-K8s-url}[ELI5 writeup].

We also recommend Marcel Wunderlich's {wunderlich-K8s-url}[4 series articles] on Kubernetes, clarifying its declarative nature, deep-diving into ingress networking, storage and monitoring.
////

See the xref:availability_scaling/availability_scaling.adoc#deployment-evolution [Deployment Evolution] description in the _Availability and Scalability_ section for reasons to use Kubernetes.

Infinite Scale follows the {12factor-url}[Twelve-Factor App] principles regarding configuration, which means almost every aspect of Infinite Scale is modifiable via environment variables.

When designing your Kubernetes cluster, you have two major approaches available which are `minikube` and `kubeadm`.

minikube::
{minikube-url}[minikube] lets you run a _single-node Kubernetes cluster locally_. It is a good way to test a deployment. It requires no extra configuration on any cloud platform as everything runs on your local machine.

kubeadm::
{kubeadm-url}[kubeadm] _requires at least two nodes_ and builds a minimum viable, production-ready Kubernetes cluster, using best practices. It also allows the container runtime to be chosen, though it has Docker by default.

A tool to note: kubectl::
{kubectl-url}[kubectl] is the command-line tool for Kubernetes. It allows users to run commands against a K8s cluster. It supports multiple contexts for as many clusters as you have access to. _minikube_ also provides kubectl wrapped as `minikube kubectcl`.

Pods::
A {kubernetes-pod-url}[Pod] is a Kubernetes abstraction that represents a group of one or more application containers such as Docker and some shared resources for those containers.

=== Helm

{helm-url}[Helm] is a Kubernetes deployment tool for automating creation, packaging, configuration and deployment of applications and services to Kubernetes clusters. Comparing Kubernetes to the operating system, Helm would be the package manager. Helm automates the maintenance of YAML manifests for Kubernetes objects. This is done by packaging information into charts -- therefore Helm Charts -- and advertising them to a Kubernetes cluster. The image below shows the interaction of Helm v3 with Kubernetes.

image::deployment/container/what-is-helm.drawio.svg[Interaction of Helm v3 with Kubernetes, width=400]

=== Prerequisites

Installing Kubernetes::
Depending on whether you want to go for a single or multi-node Kubernetes environment, follow the {K8s-setup-url}[Kubernetes Installation Documentation] to do so. This documentation will use minikube in the examples. Verify your installation by typing:
+
--
[source,bash]
----
minikube version
----
--

Installing Helm::
Follow the {helm-install-url}[Helm Installation Documentation] post installation and setup of Kubernetes. Verify your installation by typing:
+
--
[source,bash]
----
helm version
----
--

== Using Our Helm Charts with Infinite Scale

NOTE: The Helm chart is still in an experimental phase and has not yet been published on a Helm chart repository. For your convenience, ownCloud provides an {ocis-helm-charts-url}[ocis-charts] git repository.

NOTE: ownCloud will publish updated data when new Helm chart releases become available. This information will be available in additional tabs in corresponding sections. Note that two Helm chart stable versions will be documented beside the development version.

NOTE: When defining your own Helm charts, consider that, if you're using config overrides in your yaml definitions, a service does not get redefined in the override again. Multiple definitions can cause chart issues that are hard to identify.

The `values.yaml` file provided by ownCloud uses generic configuration. You can customize this configuration with your own values, for example for different setups or sizings. This should be done by using your own `values.yaml` file at a different location which will _overwrite_ or _add_ content to the provided one. While not mandatory, the identical file name of `values.yaml` follows the convention of Helm. When it comes to security sensitive data like secrets, such data is usually _not_ added in the overwrite-values file for security reasons. In such a case, you apply secrets via command from a secrets file.

=== Supported Infinite Scale Versions

See the following table to match the Helm chart versions with Infinite Scale releases. Note that the chart version matches the tag in the {ocis-helm-charts-url}[ocis-charts] git repository.

{empty}

// this table needs manual update on the "works" rows when a new Helm chart release is published

[width="60%",cols="~,~",options="header"]
|===
| Helm Chart Version
| Works with Infinite Scale Versions

| {helm_tab_1_tab_text}
| 4.0.1

| {helm_tab_2_tab_text}
| 4.0.1

| {helm_tab_3_tab_text}
| 3.0.0
|===

* If a chart has been superseded by another for the same Infinite Scale release, only the latest one is listed.
* Note that Helm Chart Version `0.2.0` was a necessary intermediate for Infinite Scale `3.0.0-alpha.1` only and is therefore not listed with a working Infinite Scale version.

=== Breaking Changes

////
* On each Helm Chart release, only the breaking-changes.adoc file MUST be maintained.
* We can of course also state that one tab has no breaking change but in this case, this needs manual maintenance on each new version in this document too.
////

Select possible breaking changes of a Helm chart version from the tabs. A new document with all details will be opened, directly referring to the selected version, although the document contains information about all published versions.

=== Supported Kubernetes Versions

////
note to adapt the _kube-versions-tab-x files
1. when a new kubernetes version is added to the list or
2. when a new ocis release gets published and the tab names change !!

for (1), just add the version to the relevant tab-x file
for (2), you need to "rotate" the content of the files.

tab-2 -> tab-3
tab-1 -> tab-2
tab-1 gets new or adapted content based on former tab-1 content

=== Get the Chart

As the Helm chart has currently not been published to a Helm repository, you need to clone ownCloud's Helm chart git repository named {ocis-helm-charts-url}[ocis-charts].

=== Start minikube

. Start your minikube cluster with the latest supported K8s version:
+
[source,bash]
----
minikube start --kubernetes-version=v1.28.1
----

. Enable the `minikube ingress` plugin, which acts like a reverse proxy for your cluster:
+
[source,bash]
----
minikube addons enable ingress
----

. Linux only: enable the `ingress-dns` plugin and configure it:
+
[source,bash]
----
minikube addons enable ingress-dns
----

. Configure the `in-cluster DNS server` to resolve local DNS names inside the cluster`:
+
Note that this step is not optional but mandatory for an Infinite Scale installation. For details see https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/handbook/addons/ingress-dns/#installation[Step 4, (optional) Configure in-cluster DNS server to resolve local DNS names inside cluster].

. macOS only: run `minikube tunnel` to be expose `80,443` ports:
+
[source,bash]
----
minikube tunnel
----

. Configure hosts:
.. On Linux you need to add additional configurations to use ingress by adding the domain names to `/etc/hosts`. Those entries need to point to the Minikube interface IP which you can get by running `minikube ip`.
+
[source,bash]
----
192.168.49.2 ocis.kube.owncloud.test
----

.. On macOS you need to add additional configurations to use ingress by adding the domain names to `/etc/hosts`. Since you are using `minikube tunnel`, those entries need to point to `127.0.0.1` because it's listening on the localhost interface.
+
[source,bash]
----
127.0.0.1 ocis.kube.owncloud.test
----

=== Deploy the Chart

// note the sources for values and description are on GitHub at ocis-charts.

:t1_text: Helm chart with default configurations.
:t2_text: Description of the values.yaml file.

* When installing Infinite Scale in Minikube on MacOS, you need to set the `hostAliases` option:
+
[source,yaml]
----
hostAliases:
  - ip: "192.168.49.2" # <- needs to be the IP of `minikube ip`
    hostnames:
      - "ocis.kube.owncloud.test"
----

* Based on the Kubernetes version, you will find comments in `values.yaml` where content depends on the Kubernetes version. Search for comments with `Kubernetes` for details.

* Deploy the chart with the deployment name `ocis`, use any name as desired. To do so, run the following command from the root of the cloned repository:
+
[source,bash]
----
helm install ocis ./charts/ocis
----

==== Define Mandatory Secrets and ConfigMaps

Infinite Scale requires some mandatory Secrets and ConfigMaps to work. They are created _one-off_ if you don't explicitly provide them. If you're using the builtin user management, which is not recommended, among the auto generated Secrets, there are also some certificates which expire and need to be renewed manually.

IMPORTANT: These Secrets and ConfigMaps need to be part of your backup since you need to provide them manually during a disaster recovery procedure.

// edit the yaml data shown at example$deployment/container/orchestration/

===== Mandatory Secrets

:t_text: List of all mandatory Secrets.

* If you want to manage Secrets on your own, you can look at the following example which shows what mandatory Secrets look like and how they can be generated. The example assumes that the `secretRefs` are not changed. Each Secret data entry holds a description of how to generate it or find the right value.

===== Apply Mandatory Secrets

Secrets can be applied by command or included in `extraResources` of your own `values.yaml` file. Adapt the data content according to your environment:

. To apply secrets by command, save the content as `mandatory-secrets.yaml` and use the following command with a path to the secrets file added if necessary:
+
[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f mandatory-secrets.yaml
----

. To apply secrets via your own `values.yaml`, add the content at `extraResources`. Proper yaml formatting is necessary.

===== Mandatory ConfigMaps

* If you want to manage ConfigMaps on your own, you can look at the following example which shows how mandatory ConfigMaps look like and how they can be generated. The example assumes that the `configRefs` are not changed. Each ConfigMaps data entry holds a description of how to generate it or find the right value.

==== Built-in User Management Secrets

If you're using the built-in user management by setting `features.externalUserManagement.enabled` to `false`, which is the default, you'll need additional Secrets. These are also autogenerated for you if you don't provide them manually.

IMPORTANT: These Secrets are certificates that expire after 365 days and therefore need a certificate rotation from time to time. Rotation can be achieved by deleting the Secrets _ldap-ca_ and _ldap-cert_ and restarting all Infinite Scale deployments like with `kubectl rollout restart deploy`.

// edit the yaml data shown at example$deployment/container/orchestration/

:t_text: Secrets file for the builtin user management.

* The following example shows what the Secrets for the built-in user management need to look like and how they can be generated. The example assumes that the `secretRefs` are not changed . Each Secret data entry holds a description of how to generate it or find the right value.

===== Apply Built-in User Management Secrets

Secrets can be applied by command or included in `extraResources` of your own `values.yaml` file. Adapt the data content according to your environment:

. To apply secrets by command, save the content as `builtin-user-mgmt-secrets.yaml` and use the following command (adding the path to the secrets file if necessary):
+
[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f builtin-user-mgmt-secrets.yaml
----

. To apply secrets via your own `values.yaml`, add the content at `extraResources`. Proper yaml formatting is necessary.

==== Custom CA Chain

If you are using a custom CA for some of your services like S3 or your mail server, it can be necessary to add a custom CA chain to your deployment.

* When adding the custom CA chain, a secret with the CA chain must be present. Multiple chains can be part of this secret.
+
--
[source,bash]
----
kubectl create secret generic ocis-custom-ca-chain --from-file=/PATH/TO/FILE
----

[source,yaml]
----
customCAChain:
  # Adds custom CA Chain to pods
  enabled: true
  # Name of existing secret
  existingSecret: "ocis-custom-ca-chain"
----

==== External User Management Secrets

If you're using external user management by setting `features.externalUserManagement.enabled` to `true`, you need to set these Secrets. Certificates are also required which should expire and therefore need a certificate rotation from time to time, for which we didn't document appropiate tooling yet.

If you're using Helm Charts, you are responsible for these user management secrets and their lifecycle. Any information necessary to use this security-relevant data is provided by ownCloud via examples.

// edit the yaml data shown at example$deployment/container/orchestration/

:t_text: Secrets file for the external user management.

* The following example shows what external user management secrets need to look like and how they can be generated. The example assumes that the `secretRefs` are not changed . Each secret data entry holds a description of how to generate it or find the right value.

==== NGINX Ingress Example

This is an example with NGINX ingress and certificates issued by cert-manager. To make this work, you need to have NGINX ingress and {cert-manager-url}[cert-manager] installed in your cluster.

// edit the yaml data shown at example$deployment/container/orchestration/

==== Apply Chart Changes

* Apply all changes defined in your _own_ `values.yaml` file:
+
[source,bash]
----
helm upgrade --install --reset-values \
    ocis ./charts/ocis --values values.yaml
----

* Ensure that all the pods are running:
+
[source,bash]
----
kubectl get pods
----

=== Access Infinite Scale in Your Browser

After you have customized your setup, use the following URL to access Infinite Scale with your browser:

[source,plaintext]
----
https://ocis.kube.owncloud.test
----

=== Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `ocis` deployment, use the following command:

[source,bash]
----
helm delete ocis
----

This command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the deployment.
