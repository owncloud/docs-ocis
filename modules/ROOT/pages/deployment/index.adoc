* The xref:deployment/general/general-info.adoc[General Info] section summarizes general and important information which is not dependent on the way that you install Infinite Scale. Any setup refers to this general information as prerequisite knowledge.

* If you only want to play around and see what Infinite Scale has to offer, we suggest the quick and easy xref:depl-examples/minimal-bare-metal.adoc[Minimal Bare Metal Deployment] section.

* If you have already decided on a container instance with one or more containers, checkout the xref:deployment/container/container-setup.adoc[Container Setup].

* For a more complex or enterprise setup, consider reading xref:deployment/container/orchestration/orchestration.adoc[Container Orchestration]. This document also covers the use of Kubernetes and Helm Charts.

* The next steps will likely be mounting a xref:deployment/storage/nfs.adoc[Network File System] and managing xref:deployment/services/services.adoc[Services].

* xref:deployment/security/security.adoc[Securing Infinite Scale] should be a primary concern after you've set up your server.
