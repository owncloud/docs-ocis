The attribute 'service_name' (mandatory) and 'no_yaml' (not mandatory) will be handed over by the calling page.
If no_yaml is set, it will exclude rendering yaml files because it does not exist.

Print a dependent explanation line:

* no_yaml is not set = standard service
* no_yaml is set     = special scope envvars

Conditional tab printing, example:

* no_second_tab = based on first appearance of the service (defined in a service),
  must overrule service tab. If there is no second, there is also no third.

* Note to make a tab hidden by no_xxx_tab showing up again, just comment it.

The included deprecation file just has an attribute necessary for rendering deprecations.
This is necessary as attributes that are defined INSIDE a tabset will not get recognized, attributes need to be defined OUTSIDE the tabset definition. example content:

:show-deprecation: true

The file contains the attribute too to be used outside of tabsets.

To exclude a deprecation file if not wanted - like when the file will just not exist, manually unset the attribute if required via:

* :!no_deprecation:

////
Important: The xxx_deprecation.adoc does not exist for extended or global envvars. It may change for global envvars! Therefore we need to query 'no_deprecation' to skip importing - or if we explicitly don't want to show deprecated content.
When rendering an included content in a table, any attribute set in the included file is dropped and can't be queried. Therefore we read upfront xxx_deprecation.adoc where only the deprecation state is set. Having this extra, we set 'show-deprecation' outside the tab but with the same value which is taken for building.

The `{service_name}` service is configured via the following environment variables. Read the xref:deployment/services/envvar-types-description.adoc[Environment Variable Types] documentation for important details.

The `{service_name}` variables are defined in the following way. Read the xref:deployment/services/envvar-types-description.adoc[Environment Variable Types] documentation for important details.
