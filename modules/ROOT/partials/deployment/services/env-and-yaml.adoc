////
The attribute 'service_name' will be handed over by the calling page.

The included deprecation file just has an attribute necessary for rendering deprecations.
This is necessary as attributes that are defined INSIDE a tabset will not get recognized, attributes like show-deprecation need to be defined OUTSIDE the tabset definition.

The included xxx_deprecation.adoc file contains the attribute identical value compared to the xxx.adoc file, to be used outside of tabsets.

Important: The xxx_deprecation.adoc does not exist for extended or global envvars. It may change for global envvars! When rendering an included content in a table, any attribute set in the included file is dropped and can't be queried. Therefore we read upfront xxx_deprecation.adoc where only the deprecation state is set. Having this extra, we set 'show-deprecation' outside the tab but with the same value which is taken for building.

| Name
| Description

| `OCIS_RUN_SERVICES`
| A comma-separated list of service names. Will start only the listed services.

| `OCIS_EXCLUDE_RUN_SERVICES`
| A comma-separated list of service names. Will start all default services except of the ones listed. Has no effect when `OCIS_RUN_SERVICES` is set.

| `OCIS_ADD_RUN_SERVICES`
| A comma-separated list of service names. Will add the listed services to the default configuration. Has no effect when `OCIS_RUN_SERVICES` is set. Note that one can add services not started by the default list and exclude services from the default list by using both envvars at the same time.
|===

Note to get the current list of services started by default, you need to run `ocis server` without restriction which services to start and run afterwards `ocis list`.

=== Environment Variables

The `{service_name}` service is configured via the following environment variables. Read the xref:deployment/services/envvar-types-description.adoc[Environment Variable Types] documentation for important details.

// load the deprecation activation file. this will overwrite the above.
include::{ocis-services-raw-url}{service_tab_1}{ocis-services-final-path}adoc/{service_name}_deprecation.adoc[]

=== YAML Example

* Note that the filename shown below has been chosen on purpose.
* See the xref:deployment/general/general-info.adoc#configuration-file-naming[Configuration File Naming] for details when setting up your own configuration.
* See the xref:deployment/services/env-var-note.adoc[Notes for Environment Variables] if you want to use environment variables in the yaml file.

The `{service_name}` variables are defined in the following way. Read the xref:deployment/services/envvar-types-description.adoc[Environment Variable Types] documentation for important details.

// do not load any deprecation activations. use the default set via ':show-deprecation: false' above
// this prevents showing any deprecations which is necessary for global envvars which currently do not have
// any deprecations configured.
