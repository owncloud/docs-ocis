=== Volumes

Volumes are the location where docker stores data. In a nutshell, docker can handle two types of volumes:

* Volumes managed by docker: +
These volumes are managed by docker and are located, if not otherwise defined, in the same partition where the OS is installed. While this is easy to handle and does not need extra configuration, you have dependencies that should be considered like sharing space, snapshotting, resetting, backup/restore, migration etc.

* External volumes: +
These volumes are not managed by docker. You need to provide docker a mount point for the volume which can be a folder, partition, external storage etc.

Note that the term volume can be used in different contexts. For example, https://www.hetzner.com[Hetzner] uses the term volume for a definable disk space that is independently provisioned and charged. Such a volume can then be connected to a docker volume to store data.  

=== Other Requirements

Firewall::
Because the server configured {text_1} is exposed to the internet, we highly recommend configuring a firewall for security reasons. {text_2}
+
NOTE: The minimum configuration for the firewall is to allow TCP port 22, 80 and 443. We also recommend to allow `ICMP` to be able to ping the server. {text_3}

Domain Name and Routing::
To access Infinite Scale from the internet, you *must*:
+
--
* Own a domain name which will get multiple subdomains configured.
** You can also use a wildcard operator for the subdomains in the DNS configuration. In cases where you already use subdomains for other purposes, we recommend using a subdomain as entry point and add the wildcard operator there to allow different IP configurations.
* The IP address {text_4} needs to be used for the (sub)domains configured.

Note that you can use any domain provider of choice.
--

eMail::
--
The following data needs to be available to configure the Infinite Scale eMail setup, see the xref:{s-path}/notifications.adoc[notifications service] for more details.

[NOTE]
====
* You must configure at minimum the `SMTP_SENDER`, even it is a dummy email like `noreply@example.com`, the deployment will not startup otherwise.
* If all other email data is not available, Infinite Scale will start but no notifications can be sent.
====

* `SMTP_HOST` +
SMTP host to connect to.
* `SMTP_PORT` +
Port of the SMTP host to connect to.
* `SMTP_SENDER` +
An eMail address that is used for sending Infinite Scale notification eMails like +
[.blue]##`ocis <\noreply@yourdomain.com>`##.
* `SMTP_USERNAME` +
Username for the SMTP host to connect to.
* `SMTP_PASSWORD` +
Password for the SMTP host to connect to.
* `SMTP_AUTHENTICATION` +
Authentication method for the SMTP communication.
* `SMTP_SECURITY` +
Define using secure or insecure connections to the SMTP server.
--

==== Domain Names

This environment requires that multiple (sub)domain names are available. You have to deviate from the examples according to your environment. The (sub)domains must be configured to point to the server you configured. The same is true when using a wildcard configuration. For a wildcard setup on the DNS, three (sub)domains must be provided to configure the `.env` file described in one of the next sections.

The following (sub)domains are required at minimum, an example is printed for each, replace them according to your environment:

* `OCIS_DOMAIN` +
[.blue]##`ocis.yourdomain.com`##

* `COLLABORA_DOMAIN` +
[.blue]##`collabora.yourdomain.com`##

* `WOPISERVER_DOMAIN` +
[.blue]##`wopiserver.yourdomain.com`##

Note that more (sub)domains may be required depending on your setup. See the `.env` file more details.

== Accessing Infinite Scale

Infinite Scale can be accessed from the internet and from your local network via a browser using the URL defined in `OCIS_DOMAIN`:

image::depl-examples/ubuntu-compose/{overview_image}[Network Overview, width=400]

== Limitations

Data Location::
If not otherwise setup and configured, all data is stored in volumes managed by docker in the same partition of the server. If you want to define your own volume paths, provide the paths and configure them in the `.env` file accordingly. This is highly recommended for production environments and described in the xref:hardware[Hardware] and xref:volumes[Volumes] sections above.

User and User Access Management::
The following embedded services are well suited for home use and smaller businesses though Infinite Scale can be configured to use external products which is relevant for bigger installations and not covered here.
+
--
* Infinite Scale has an embedded identity management (IDM footnote:[See the xref:{s-path}/idm.adoc[IDM, window=_blank] service for more details]) which takes care of creating, storing, and managing user identity information.

* In addition, it also has an embedded identity provider (IDP footnote:[See the xref:{s-path}/idp.adoc[IDP, window=_blank] service for more details]) to track and manage user identities, as well as the permissions and access levels associated with those identities.

tag::hetzner_only_1[]

== Prepare Hetzner

=== SSH Key

We recommend using key-based authentication for ssh to access the configured server instead of using user and password. This is not only beneficial for security reasons but also because you can define the public key to be installed  during the initial server configuration.

All OS::
Follow the https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/keygen[ssh-keygen guide] to generate the required keys. We recommend, if possible, using the `ed25519` algorithm and a passphrase for enhanced security. The keys to use after generation are located in `~/.ssh`. Name the keys during the generation process accordingly to avoid overwrite existing ones.

Use the public key::
+
--
* During server setup described in one of the sections below, you can use the content of the public key file to setup ssh authentication when asked.

* Alternativerly, after the server has been created, you can copy the _public_ key to the server by adding the _contents_ of the generated `<key>.pub` file to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file manually. This step is necessary, because the server does not have password authentication which would be required to transfer the key by command.
--

Additionally for Windows::
+
--
* When using Putty to access your server, you must convert the _private_ key generated into Putty's `ppk` format. Read the https://www.puttygen.com[puttygen] guide for how to do so. You need to specify on each login the ppk file generated via menu:Connection[SSH > Auth > Connections > Private key file].

* When using the command shell with ssh to login or when using SCP, you need to:
** The private/public keys must be located in `C:\Users\<user>\.ssh\`
** Add the following to `C:\Users\<user>\.ssh\config`
+
[source,plaintext]
----
Host <the-servers-public-url-or-ip>
    PreferredAuthentications publickey
    PasswordAuthentication no
    IdentityFile C:\Users\<user>\.ssh\<private-key-name>
----
--

=== Login to Hetzner

If you do not already have an account on https://www.hetzner.com[Hetzner], register for free and log in.

image::depl-examples/ubuntu-compose/hetzner-register-login.png[Hetzner Login or register, width=250]

=== Configure and Order the Desired Server

After logging in, select from the selector on the top right the `cloud` item.

image::depl-examples/ubuntu-compose/hetzner-select-cloud.png[Select Cloud, width=150]

Then, you either can use an existing project, if you have one, or create a `new project`.

image::depl-examples/ubuntu-compose/hetzner-create-new-project.png[Create new project, width=300]

Select the project of choice and in the new screen click on btn:[Add Server].

In the following screen, you can define the::
--
* *Server Location* (Choose one from the offered)
* *Image* (we use Ubuntu for this deployment)
* *Type* (select any server type that matches your requirements)
* *Networking* (we recommend using IPv4 as well as IPv6)
* *SSH keys* (here you enter the public key you created before)
* *Volumes* (add a volume if you want to separate the OS from the data) +
This can be done at any time after the first setup but needs data migration. The volumes defined can then be used by xref:edit-the-configuration-file[configuring variables] in the `.env` file
* *Firewall* (add a rule for at minimum port 22, 80 and 443, can be added later on too)
* ... there can be more items not listed here, configure them according your needs.
* *Name* (define a name for the server)
--

After you have finished, the server is built, and when done, you can click on it which opens a screen with more details and post-configuration options.

image::depl-examples/ubuntu-compose/hetzner-server-defined.png[Server View, width=300]

NOTE: In this screen, you also see the IP address of the server that is necessary to be used for the domains pointing to this server.

end::hetzner_only_1[]


tag::shared_2[]

== Add the IP Address to the Domains

After the server has been finally setup, you must use the IP address assigned to {text_5} to configure DNS mapping at your DNS provider accordingly. If you have allowed ICMP requests in the firewall settings, you can then ping your server with one of the domain names defined.

== Prepare the Server

As a standard regular task, you need to update packages, especially after first server login. Open a shell on the server and issue the following command:

[source,bash]
----
apt-get update && apt-get upgrade
----

=== Install Required Software Packages

Note that we do not recommend using the Ubuntu embedded Docker installations but install and upgrade them manually to get the latest releases.

Docker Engine::
Follow this guide to install `docker`: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository[Install using the apt repository, window=_blank].

Docker Compose::
Follow this guide to install `docker compose`: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/#install-the-plugin-manually[Install the Compose plugin, window=_blank].

unzip::
+
--
The package `unzip` may not be present. In case install with:
[source,bash]
----
apt install unzip
----
--

== Download and Transfer the Example

NOTE: The client to download the example is not the server you upload to. The server does not have a graphical interface (GUI) and therefore no browser. The example commands below are based on a Linux client. If you are using macOS or Windows, the commands need to be adapted accordingly. This mainly effects the location the browser downloads to (`~/Downloads`).

NOTE: The client from where you download the example via a browser and upload it using `scp` must have granted access to the server and have the `scp` app installed.

To download and extract the necessary deployment example footnote:[Derived from the {compose_url}v{compose_version}{compose_final_path}/{ocis_wopi}/[{ocis_wopi}, window=_blank] developer example], *open a browser* and enter the following URL:

//[source,url,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
//----
//----

[.gray-light-background]
****
{download-gh-directory-url}?url={compose_url}v{compose_version}{compose_final_path}/{ocis_wopi}[,window=_blank]
****

The `.zip` file will be downloaded into your local `Download` directory.

Transfer the `.zip` file created to the server by issuing the following command, *replace* `root@182.83.2.94` with the username and address of the server according your setup:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
scp ~/Downloads/'owncloud ocis v{compose_version} deployments-examples_{ocis_wopi}.zip' root@182.83.2.94:/opt
----

Note that the command differs a bit on Windows due to way how the home directory and the path separator is defined.

NOTE: With the next step, if you have already unzipped that file before or if you intend to update an existing extract with a new compose version downloaded, the `.env` file will get *overwritten* without notice and you need to xref:edit-the-configuration-file[reconfigure] this deployment!

== Extract the Example

Login into the server and:

* Create a subdirectory to save all compose files and folders.
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
mkdir -p /opt/compose/ocis/{ocis_wopi}
----

* Extract the zip file into the directory by issuing the following command:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
unzip -d /opt/compose/ocis/{ocis_wopi} \
  /opt/'owncloud ocis v{compose_version} deployments-examples_{ocis_wopi}.zip'
----

* When files have been extracted, list the directory with:
+
--
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
ls -la /opt/compose/ocis/{ocis_wopi}/
----

The listing should contain files and folders like the following:

[source,subs="+quotes"]
----
clamav.yml
cloudimporter.yml
collabora.yml
[.aqua]#config#
...
----
--

== Edit the Configuration File

Change into the `/opt/compose/ocis/{ocis_wopi}` directory and open the `.env` file with an editor.

Only a few settings need to be configured:

* `INSECURE` +
Comment this line because we are on an internet facing server.

* `TRAEFIK_ACME_MAIL` +
Add a valid response eMail address for Letsencrypt, see the note below.

* `TRAEFIK_ACME_CASERVER` +
Set the CAServer to staging, see the note below.

* `OCIS_DOCKER_IMAGE` +
Check that the correct image type is selected ({version-type}).

* `OCIS_DOMAIN`, `COLLABORA_DOMAIN` and `WOPISERVER_DOMAIN` +
Set the domain names as defined in xref:domain-names[Domain Names].

* `OCIS_CONFIG_DIR` and `OCIS_DATA_DIR` +
If you expect a higher amount of data in the instance, consider using own paths instead of using docker internal volumes.

* `SMTP_xxx` +
Define these settings according to your eMail configuration. With the settings defined, Infinite Scale is able to send notifications to users. If the settings are not defined, Infinite Scale will start, but notifications can't be sent.

NOTE: When not defining your own domain names, internal evaluation only domain names with self-signed certificates are used automatically.

NOTE: There can be additional options to be configured like web apps. These should be configured after successfully starting the deployment without issues. This eases finding any first startup issues that need to be solved first.
 
== Certificate Generation Process

The recommended process to generate live certificates is the following:

. First, let LetsEncrypt generate "fake" certificates. These certifcates show that the process works but they cant be used in production. To do so, the environment variable `TRAEFIK_ACME_CASERVER` needs to be set to LetsEncrypt's https://letsencrypt.org/docs/staging-environment/[Staging Environment, window=_blank], see the `.env` file for the value to be set. By doing so, any restart after fixing issues will not count against the rate limit of LetsEncrypt.

. The `TRAEFIK_ACME_MAIL` must be set to a valid eMail address you own. When certificate issuing is triggered, LetsEncrypt checks in the request for creating valid certificates, if the response eMail address is valid and continues if so. If not, it logs an error and self-signed certificates are being used, see see xref:solving-first-startup-issues[Solving First Startup Issues].

. xref:start-the-deployment[Start the Deployment].

. Then, if any issues occur, you need to xref:stop-the-deployment[Stop the Deployment] and fix them before continuing with the next step. See xref:solving-first-startup-issues[Solving First Startup Issues] for a list of common issues, 

. Finally, if there are no (more) issues which you can identify because `Fake LE intermediate X1` certificates have been generated (check the certificate issuer in the browser, Google for how to do so), you must xref:delete-cert-volume[delete the `cert-volume`] and set back the `TRAEFIK_ACME_CASERVER` environment variable to empty and startup the instance as described below.

== Start the Deployment

When you have finished the configuration, you can start the deployment by issuing the following command:

[source,bash]
----
docker compose up -d
----

This command will download all necessary containers and starts up the instance according your settings in the background (flag `-d`).

Check the logs::
--
* See xref:monitor-the-instance[Monitor the Instance] for more details on logging.
* First check the traefik logs for certificate issues, then other logs. See xref:solving-first-startup-issues[Solving First Startup Issues] for more details.
--

If no issues are logged, traefik and LetsEncrypt were able to handle connectivity and domains.

In case you have used staging certificates as suggested above,

* xref:stop-the-deployment[stop the deployment],
* xref:delete-cert-volume[delete the `cert-volume`]
* and start the deployment as described above.

When done, recheck the xref:monitor-the-instance[traefik logs] and when all is fine, you can access your instance, see xref:first-time-login[First Time Login].

=== Solving First Startup Issues

Note, see xref:monitor-the-instance[Monitor the Instance] for more details on logging.

If any issues are logged by traefik on first startup with respect to LetsEncrypt like:

Common issues::
+
--
* `...Contact emails @example.org are forbidden`: +
The environment variable `TRAEFIK_ACME_MAIL` needs to be set to a valid eMail address you own.

* `...unable to generate a certificate for the domains...`, `acme: error: 400` and `acme-challenge`: +
Check if the TCP ports 80/443 are open in the firewall configured. You can run a test _during running compose_ to test if traefik can be reached on those ports. To do so visit https://letsdebug.net[Let's Debug].

* `...DNS problem: NXDOMAIN looking up A for...` +
This points to a DNS resolution problem. Check if the domains entered in the DNS and in the `.env` file match. Note that when using wildcard domains on the DNS, the fixed part must match on both sides.

For any issue fixed, before you bring up the instance again, some steps need to be taken. This is because the certificate volume now holds invalid data:
--

[#delete-cert-volume]
Post fixing the issue::
+
--
The following actions need to be taken before starting the deployment again:

.Shut down the deployment
[source,bash]
----
docker compose down
----
Note, do not use the `-v` option as it will delete ALL volumes.

.List the docker volumes
[source,bash]
----
docker volume ls
----

.Delete the docker certs volume
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
docker volume rm {ocis_wopi}_certs
----
--

== Stop the Deployment

Stopping the deployment is easy, just issue:

[source,bash]
----
docker compose down --remove-orphans
----

For safety reasons, *do not* add the `-v` (volumes) flag to the command as that would delete all volumes including their data. If deleting volumes is necessary, deleting them selectively is the preferred method, see the section above for an example. See the `docker compose down` https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/compose/down/#options[options] for more details.

== Change Settings
 
To change settings via the `.env` file, the deployment _must be_ in the `down` state. See the section above for how to do so.

== First Time Login

Now, after preparations have finished, you can access your instance *from any client*. To do so, open your browser and enter the instance URL as you have defined it:

[source,URL]
----
ocis.yourdomain.com
----

Which will show the following screen:

image::depl-examples/ubuntu-compose/infinite-scale-login.png[Infinite Scale Login, width=300]

For the credentials, use:

* `admin` as user and 
* `admin` for the password, +
or the one you have defined manually during setup.

NOTE: If you have defined an initial password via the `.env` file manually but forgot it, you need to follow one of the procedures described in the xref:admin-password[Admin Password] section.

If you have logged in successfully, you should see the following screen:

image::depl-examples/ubuntu-compose/infinite-scale-logged-in.png[Infinite Scale Logged In, width=300]

*Congratulations*, you have successfully setup Infinite Scale with Web Office.

TIP: Checkout the https://doc.owncloud.com/[Desktop App] or https://doc.owncloud.com/[Mobile Apps] to sync files to/from clients.

NOTE: The Infinite Scale deployment will reboot automatically on a server reboot if the compose environment is not shut down by command.

Among other topics described below, some basic xref:monitor-the-instance[monitoring] commands and a short description to xref:updating[update] Infinite Scale is provided.

== Monitor the Instance

=== Container

To get the state and the Container ID, issue one of the following commands:

.Long form, this command will print the required Container ID, among other data 
[source,bash]
----
docker ps -a
----

.Short form with only the Service name, State and Container ID, needs to be issued in `/opt/compose/ocis/{ocis_wopi}`:
[source,bash]
----
docker compose ps -a --format "table {{.Service}}\t{{.State}}\t{{.ID}}"
----

=== Logs

Issue the following command to monitor a log:

.Replace the <container_id> according to the container for which you want to monitor the log.
[source,bash]
----
docker logs -f <container_id>
----

== Admin Password

=== Initial Admin Password from Docker Log

If the manually set *initial* admin password has been forgotten *before* it got changed, you can get it from the docker log. See the https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/[View container logs] for more details on docker logging.

First you need to get the Infinite Scale `CONTAINER ID`:

[source,bash]
----
docker compose ps -a --format "table {{.Service}}\t{{.State}}\t{{.ID}}"
----

From the output, see an example below, note the container ID that matches `ocis`:

[source,subs="+quotes"]
----
SERVICE         STATE     CONTAINER ID
collabora       running   a7f74dfbbec3
collaboration   running   ed4d086ddd06
[.aqua]#ocis#            running   [.aqua]#b395d936c23a#
tika            running   08ae7b0c9c0e
traefik         running   5f0e1d03bcbf
----

Use the container ID identified in the following command to read the Infinite Scale logs to get the initial admin password created, replace <CONTAINER ID> accordingly:

[source,bash]
----
docker logs <CONTAINER ID> 2>&1 | less
----

The output prints the log from the beginning. As first entry, the initial admin password set during first startup is shown. You can scroll thru the log using the keyboard, see the https://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/less/[less description] for more details.

If no password can be identified, you must reset the admin password via the command line as described below.

=== Command Line Password Reset

To change the admin password from the command line, which you can do at any time, follow the guide described in xref:deployment/general/general-info.adoc#password-reset-for-the-admin-user[Password Reset for the Admin User].

== Volume Migration

This section gives some guidance if you want to migrate the Infinite Scale docker internal volumes to docker volumes using a local path. For example, this can be required to separate the container from its data or if a high data volume is expected. See additional documentation in the xref:deployment/tips/useful_mount_tip.adoc[Start a Service After a Resource is Mounted] if you want to use network mounts like NFS or iSCSI for the data directory.

* Prepare two directories which will provide the mount point for Infinite Scale `data` and `config`. +
The example will use the local path `/mnt/data` and `mnt/config`, adapt according your environment.

* For the following steps, the deployment _must be_ in the `up` state, the containers must provide a container ID for copying.

** Stop the running instance. By doing so, the instance gets stopped but containers are not removed compared to when downing it:
+
[source,bash]
----
docker compose stop
----

** Get the `ocis` container ID using one of the xref:container[maintenance - Container] commands.

** Copy both the content of the docker internal `ocis-config` and `ocis-data` volume to their new local location by issuing the following commands, replace `<CONTAINER ID>` accordingly:
+
[source,bash]
----
docker cp <CONTAINER ID>:/etc/ocis/. /mnt/config
docker cp <CONTAINER ID>:/var/lib/ocis/. /mnt/data
----

** Change the ownership of the new source folders recursively. This step is _very important_ because the user inside the container is `1000` and will mostly not match the user who copied the folders:
+
[source,bash]
----
chown -R 1000:1000 /mnt/config /mnt/data
----

* Down the compose instance by issuing:
+
[source,bash]
----
docker compose down
----

** In the `.env` file, set the paths:
+
[source,.env]
----
OCIS_DATA_DIR=/mnt/data
OCIS_CONFIG_DIR=/mnt/config
----

* Bring the compose environment `up` with:
+
[source,bash]
----
docker compose up
----

** If the containers come up without reporting issues, you have successfully moved your Infinite Scale docker internal volumes to local paths.

* Finally, you can remove the docker internal volumes for `config` and `data`:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
docker volume ls
docker volume rm {ocis_wopi}_ocis-config {ocis_wopi}_ocis-data
----

== Updating and Upgrading

=== Updating

// for testing
//:version-type: production

ifeval::["{version-type}" == "rolling"]
For rolling releases, the following steps are essential to avoid breaking the setup. This is because rolling releases depend on all updates being done consecutively.

If new Infinite Scale releases are available, you *must not* skip any version in between the current running and the latest available rolling release for internal update reasons. All versions need to be downloaded and started one time. For more details see the https://owncloud.dev/ocis/release_roadmap/#updating-and-overlap[Updating and Overlap] description in the developer documentation.

* Each upgrade consists of a set of commands:
+
[source,bash]
----
sudo docker compose stop \
sudo docker compose pull \
sudo docker compose up -d --remove-orphans
----

* If there is no release gap, run the command block once.

* For *any* https://owncloud.dev/ocis/release_roadmap/#dates[release gap], you must run the command block from above once and set the respective release in the `OCIS_DOCKER_TAG` _before_ pulling. Use no value for the last release, it defaults to `latest`.

* Check if there are any Infinite Scale config changes. To do so, run a `ocis init --diff` plus apply any patches. The detailed how-to is described in the xref:migration/upgrading-ocis.adoc[Upgrading Infinite Scale] guide for 7.0.0. When done, bring the deployment up.

* Finally, you can remove any old images if no longer used.

Note that we advise to manually check if the deployment source has changed. If this is the case, stop the deployment, backup your existing deployment source/configuration and update the xref:download-and-transfer-the-example[deployment sources], then re-apply your configuration settings and bring the deployment up.

endif::[]

ifeval::["{version-type}" != "rolling"]

Follow these steps to update between production releases:

For patch releases only!::
+
--
These commands will stop the deployment, update all images and start the deployment again. This works because the relevant `xxx_TAG` variables in the `.env` file are set to `latest` by default while others have hardcoded versions set.

[source,bash]
----
sudo docker compose stop \
sudo docker compose pull \
sudo docker compose up -d --remove-orphans
----
{empty}
--

endif::[]

=== Upgrading

For all major and minor releases including from former rolling to production::
+
--
* Stop the deployment with:
+
[source,bash]
----
sudo docker compose stop
----

* If upgrading from rolling to production, change the `OCIS_DOCKER_IMAGE` environment variable from `owncloud/ocis-rolling` to `owncloud/ocis` in the `.env` file.

* Follow the respective xref:migration/upgrading-ocis.adoc[Upgrading Infinite Scale] guide.

* Backup your existing deployment source/configuration and update the xref:download-and-transfer-the-example[deployment sources] - if they have been changed, re-apply your configuration settings.

* Re-pull the deployment. This will update all images with any versions that might have changed.
+
[source,bash]
----
sudo docker compose pull
----

* Start the deployment.
+
[source,bash]
----
sudo docker compose up -d --remove-orphans
----
--

== Certificate Renewal

There is nothing special to do renewing certificates issued. Traefik takes care of the renewal process automatically. In case of a renewal issue, just restart the compose environment as Traefik checks certificate expiry on startup.

end::shared_2[]
