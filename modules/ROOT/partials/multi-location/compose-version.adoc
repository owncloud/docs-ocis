depending of the version (production/rolling) attributes get defined dynamically

'compose_tab_text' from the version (branch) can be 'master' (only in next). in this case we must use the site.yml's 'ocis-rolling-version' to point to a number and not master. this is necessary to dynamically have a version number used and never master as this does not work with docker! we also cant use 'latest' as we have to stick to the referenced stable version.

antora-component-version: is either next or a branched version defined in antora.yml
ocis-rolling-version:     is the actual rolling version defined in site.yml
compose_tab_text:         is either master or a stable version defined in antora.yml
