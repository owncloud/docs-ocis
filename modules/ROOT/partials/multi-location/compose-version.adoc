depending of the version (production/rolling), attributes get defined dynamically

if the branch is master, identified via the component version equals 'next', we have a rolling release
if the branch is anything else, it is a production version and has its own branch

the outcome guarantees that we always access the correct paths to get or reference source files from

ocis-rolling-version:     defined in site.yml:      is the actual rolling version
ocis_repo_url_component:  defined in antora.yml:    is either master or a branched version
page-component-version:   intrinsic via antora.yml: is either next or a branched version like 7.1
(antora-component-version: intrinsic via antora.yml: is either next or a branched version like 7.1)

// first we define the default
// production (because it has an own doc branch)
// url is either master or like stable-7.1
:compose_version: {ocis_repo_url_component}

ifeval::["{page-component-version}" == "next"]
// but if it is the master branch defined as next, we need to redefine
