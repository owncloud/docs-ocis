The {service_name} service can use a configured store via the global `{env_store}` environment variable.

Note that for each global environment variable, a service-based one might be available additionally. For precedences see xref:deployment/services/env-var-note.adoc[Environment Variable Notes]. Check the configuration section below. Supported stores are:

{empty}

|===
| Store Type
| Description

| `memory`
| Basic in-memory store. +
Usually the default for caches, see the store environment variable for which one is used.

| `redis-sentinel`
| Stores data in a configured Redis Sentinel cluster.

| `nats-js-kv`
| Stores data using key-value-store feature of https://docs.nats.io/nats-concepts/jetstream/key-value-store[NATS JetStream]. +
Usually the default for stores, see the store environment variable for which one is used.

| `noop`
| Stores nothing. Useful for testing. Not recommended in production environments.

NOTE: The {service_name} service can only be scaled if not using the `memory` store and the stores are configured identically over all instances!

NOTE: If you have used one of the deprecated stores of a former version, you should reconfigure to use one of the supported ones as the deprecated stores will be removed in a later version.

Store specific notes::
+
--
* When using `redis-sentinel`: +
The Redis master to use is configured via e.g. `{env_nodes}` in the form of `<sentinel-host>:<sentinel-port>/<redis-master>` like `10.10.0.200:26379/mymaster`.

* When using `nats-js-kv`: +
** It is recommended to set `{env_nodes}` to the same value as `OCIS_EVENTS_ENDPOINT`. That way the cache uses the same nats instance as the event bus. See the xref:event-bus-configuration[Event Bus Configuration] for more details.
** Authentication can be added, if configured, via `OCIS_CACHE_AUTH_USERNAME` and `OCIS_CACHE_AUTH_PASSWORD`.
** It is possible to set `OCIS_CACHE_DISABLE_PERSISTENCE` to instruct nats to not persist cache data on disc.
