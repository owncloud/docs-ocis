This partial contains the commonly used list of cache stores plus notes.
It is used as partial so when there is a change, we only need to do it in one place
When including, there must be at the top and the bottom a line manually added describing service dependent stuff, see below.

The {service_name} service can use a configured store via the global {env_store} environment variable.

Note that for each global environment variable, a service-based one might be available additionally. For precedences see xref:deployment/services/env-var-note.adoc[Environment Variable Notes]. Check the configuration section below. Supported stores are:
{empty} +
{empty} +

|===
| Store Type
| Description

| `memory`
| Basic in-memory store and the default.

| `redis-sentinel`
| Stores data in a configured Redis Sentinel cluster.

| `nats-js-kv`
| Stores data using key-value-store feature of https://docs.nats.io/nats-concepts/jetstream/key-value-store[NATS JetStream]

| `noop`
| Stores nothing. Useful for testing. Not recommended in production environments.

| `ocmem`
| *(deprecated)* Advanced in-memory store allowing max size.

| `redis`
| *(deprecated)* Stores data in a configured Redis cluster.

| `etcd`
| *(deprecated)* Stores data in a configured etcd cluster.

| `nats-js`
| *(deprecated)* Stores data using the key-value-store feature of https://docs.nats.io/nats-concepts/jetstream/key-value-store[NATS JetStream].
|===

Other store types may work but are currently not supported.

NOTE: The {service_name} service can only be scaled if not using the `memory` store and the stores are configured identically over all instances!

NOTE: If you have used one of the deprecated stores of a former version, you should reconfigure to use one of the supported ones as the deprecated stores will be removed in a later version.

Store specific notes::
+
--
* When using `redis-sentinel`: +
The Redis master to use is configured via e.g. `{env_nodes}` in the form of `<sentinel-host>:<sentinel-port>/<redis-master>` like `10.10.0.200:26379/mymaster`.

* When using `nats-js-kv`: +
** It is recommended to set `{env_nodes}` to the same value as `OCIS_EVENTS_ENDPOINT`. That way the cache uses the same nats instance as the event bus.
** Authentication can be added, if configured, via `OCIS_CACHE_AUTH_USERNAME` and `OCIS_CACHE_AUTH_PASSWORD`.
** It is possible to set `OCIS_CACHE_DISABLE_PERSISTENCE` to instruct nats to not persist cache data on disc.
