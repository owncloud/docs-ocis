////
This partial contains the commonly used list of cache stores plus notes.
It is used as partial so when there is a change, we only need to do it in one place
When including, there must be at the top and the bottom a line manually added describing service dependent stuff, see below.
////

// to be added manually like:
// The `frontend` service can use a configured store via `FRONTEND_OCS_RESOURCE_INFO_CACHE_STORE`.

Note that for each service-based environment variable, a global one might be available additionally. Check the configuration section below. Possible stores are:
{empty} +
{empty} +

|===
| Store Type
| Description

| `memory`
| Basic in-memory store and the default.

| `ocmem`
| Advanced in-memory store allowing max size.

| `redis`
| Stores data in a configured Redis cluster.

| `redis-sentinel`
| Stores data in a configured Redis Sentinel cluster.

| `etcd`
| Stores data in a configured etcd cluster.

| `nats-js`
| Stores data using the key-value-store feature of https://docs.nats.io/nats-concepts/jetstream/key-value-store[NATS JetStream].

| `noop`
| Stores nothing. Useful for testing. Not recommended in production environments.
|===

. Note that in-memory stores are by nature not reboot-persistent.
. Though usually not necessary, a database name and a database table can be configured for event stores if the event store supports this. Generally not applicable for stores of type `in-memory`. These settings are blank by default which means that the standard settings of the configured store apply.
. The {service_name} service can be scaled if not using `in-memory` stores and the stores are configured identically over all instances.
// no blank lines here, this will break continuous numbering!!
// to be added manually like:
// . When using `redis-sentinel`, the Redis master to use is configured via `FRONTEND_OCS_RESOURCE_INFO_CACHE_STORE_NODES` in the form of `<sentinel-host>:<sentinel-port>/<redis-master>` like `10.10.0.200:26379/mymaster`.
