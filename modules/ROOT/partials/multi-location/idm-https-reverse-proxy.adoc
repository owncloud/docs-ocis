:ocis_port: 9200

[NOTE]
====
If you want to reuse an already configured _minimized_ setup for any _other_ address than `\https://localhost:{ocis_port}`:

* When accessing the server using the hostname or IP:
** You *must* start Infinite Scale using the environment variable `OCIS_URL=<hostname or IP>`. +
See the following sections for more details and information:
*** xref:deployment/general/general-info.adoc#starting-infinite-scale-with-environment-variables[Starting Infinite Scale With Environment Variables] and 
*** xref:deployment/general/general-info.adoc#configurations-to-access-the-web-ui[Configurations to Access the Web UI].

* When accessing the server using a dedicated domain name:
** You *must* use a reverse proxy. When Infinite Scale is accessed, it forwards requests to the embedded xref:{s-path}/idp.adoc[IDP service] which requires a secure connection and a domain name that matches the reverse proxy settings. See the xref:depl-examples/bare-metal.adoc[Bare Metal Deployment with systemd] for more details on using a reverse proxy setup.
